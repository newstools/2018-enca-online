\PRETORIA - Police Minister Fikile Mbalula will outline the process to appoint a new head for the Hawks crime-fighting unit on Wednesday. This follows the Constitutional Court's dismissal of retired General Berning Ntlemeza’s application for pardon and leave to appeal his dismissal. READ: Gupta probe: Hawks will cooperate with FBI The elite unit was established in 2008 after the disbandment of its predecessor, the Scorpions. Former Hawks head Anwa Dramat was suspended two days before Christmas in 2014 after an investigation into his alleged involvement in the 2011 illegal rendition of Zimbabweans. But not long afterwards it was reported that the Independent Police Investigative Directorate had cleared Dramat of the charges. This raised questions about the motive for his suspension. Dramat claimed in court papers when he stepped down that his suspension by then Police Minister Nathi Nhleko was a smokescreen. Dramat’s replacement, Ntlemeza, was mired in controversy even before his permanent appointment in 2015. In the same year, the courts found that he'd lied under oath and lacked integrity. It has been reported that Ntlemeza was strategically placed to carry out a political agenda, much like Dramat. Last year, Mbalula appointed Yolisa Matakata, a former deputy lieutenant-general of the Hawks, as acting Hawks head. Though she is relatively unknown, her career within the police spans 15 years.

It now remains to be seen whether the process to be outlined by Mbalula will cement the independence of the Hawks. eNCA
