BANGKOK - It’s tough answering questions, especially from journalists. So, one politician found a unique way around them. Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-o-cha avoided a barrage of questions. He rolled out a life-sized, cardboard, cutout of himself, shortly after delivering his Children's Day address, telling journalists to address their questions to it. The media were left understandably confused when Chan-o-cha then walked off. He loves himself so much, he has eight versions himself. eNCA
