"I must say to you that some of the reports circulating about him being on the way out, I’m not sure where that is coming from. Yesterday I had a meeting with the office of the chairman and they are saying they are no discussion about Mr Koko exiting the company and getting a golden handshake," said Khulu Phasis from Eskom. "The brain Molefe matter is currently in the court and I’m sure in due course will hear from the court. The R30-million was not given to him it was transferred to the Eskom pension fund and he wasn’t to draw monthly. The whole process has been frozen and he cannot access that money," he said. eNCA
