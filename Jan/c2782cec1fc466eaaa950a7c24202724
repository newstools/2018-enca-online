The party, which elected Cyril Ramaphosa as its new leader, has ruled South Africa since the end of apartheid in 1994. In a statement, the ANC said its birthday celebration takes place in the year in which South Africa and the world will celebrate 100 years since the birth of Nelson Mandela. "In celebrating the last 106 years of the African National Congress, we must never lose sight of the selfless sacrifices of thousands of people, many remain nameless and faceless who gave their lives for the freedoms we enjoy today." On Friday, Ramaphosa will pay a courtesy visit to the family of struggle stalwart Henry Fazzie. On Thursday, Ramaphosa and other ANC leaders visited former President Nelson Mandela’s family in Qunu. They also paid a courtesy visit to the Abathembu Royal family, whose king, Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo, is serving a 12-year prison sentence. - Additional reporting ANA eNCA
