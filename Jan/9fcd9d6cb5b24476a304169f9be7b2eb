JOHANNESBURG - Radio personality and comedian Tumi Morake and members of her family who were involved in a horrific crash on Friday are recovering, the comedian said on Tuesday. "On behalf of my family, i would like to thank you for all your well wishes and support. Everyone involved in the accident is well on the mend, we are keeping up with each other's progress. It is a miracle no lives were lost. Thank you to the Almighty, thank you," she tweeted. Morake was involved in a head-on collision while travelling towards Sun City on the R556 outside Rustenburg on Friday night. In the past few months, Morake has irked some people with her views on her radio show and this resulted with some social media users rejoicing after she was in an accident. They labelled it as "Karma".Â  So, @tumi_morake is in an accident and some people call that karma. What about "Do unto others ..." ? Sick and kindergarten escapee-esque. Get real, people ! #TumiMorake eNCA
