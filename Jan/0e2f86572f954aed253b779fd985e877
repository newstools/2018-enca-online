CAPE TOWN - Cape Town’s taps may run dry sooner than projected after ‘Day Zero’, the day which Cape Town runs out of water, was moved forward to 12 April 2017. This is around nine days earlier than initially thought, based on the council’s average weekly dam level tracker. IN NUMBERS: What it's going to take to stick to Cape Town's water limits Last week, it was estimated that Day Zero would be on 21 April 2017. Officials cautioned that the new date is subject to change, based on a number of variables. Due to the severity of the water crisis, level 6B water restrictions will take effect from 1 February, meaning residents will only be permitted to use 50 liters of water per person, per day. The Western Cape is experiencing its worst drought in over 100 years. eNCA
