SCHWEIZER-RENEKE - Farmers in the North West town of Schweizer Reneke say they are scared to talk to the media about a case of stock theft allegedly involving ANC MP Mmapule Mafolo. Mafolo had initially agreed to talk to eNCA but backed out of the interview at the last minute. She was arrested at a livestock auction. READ: ANC MP arrested for alleged stock theft Mafolo and two co-accused appeared in court on Monday. One of the men is alleged to be the MP's partner, while the other is an employee at the farm on which the alleged theft occurred. The two men were granted bail of R800 each, while Mafolo is out on a warning. The provincial ANC has condemned the alleged theft of two calves, worth around R14,000. The animals were then found in the possession of the three accused, who were trying to auction them. Farmers in the area won't talk on the record, saying it's a sensitive matter. Off the record, one resident said the problem has reached crisis point. Mafolo is due back in court on 19 February. The ANC in North West says the law must take its course. eNCA
