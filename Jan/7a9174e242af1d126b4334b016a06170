The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal believes the murder of another party member was not politically motivated. According to Mdumiseli Ntuli, a spokesman for the ANC KwaZulu-Natal, "We are not aware of any problems in his branch, nor are we aware of any problems that were reported to his family by him in relation to him having a problem with some of the comrades...It's very difficult to tell what could have led to his assassination, but we believe the work of the police would help us come closer to  much more informed information about what led to his assassination." eNCA
