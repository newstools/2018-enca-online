JOHANNESBURG - Bidvest Wits coach Gavin Hunt says his team “just have to keep battling on”  when they face SuperSport United at the Bidvest Stadium on Wednesday (7.30pm). Wits had hoped for a different start to 2018 but their 1-0 defeat at home against Free State Stars sees the Braamfontein outfit stuck in the 16th position on the Absa Premiership log. “We can’t be frustrated, we have to concentrate and be disciplined in our approach and each person has to do their job in their area. Most importantly as a unit, we have to do the job together, there are no shortcuts and easy fixes in this game and sometimes certain things happen for a reason and we just have to keep battling on,” said Hunt.
