BARCELONA - Philippe Coutinho officially joined Barcelona on Monday, completing a move from Liverpool thought to be worth 160 million euros (R2.3-billion), making it the third richest transfer in history. Coutinho, 25, signed a contract in a ceremony alongside Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu. Unfortunately for the Brazilian, he will not be able to make his debut for Barcelona until the end of January because he has a thigh injury, the club said on Monday. "Coutinho has an injury to his right thigh and he is expected to be out for around three weeks," Barcelona said on their website.  The Brazilian midfielder could in theory make his debut on January 28 when Alaves visit the Camp Nou in La Liga. AFP
