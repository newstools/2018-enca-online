JOHANNESBURG - South African rapper Senzo Vilakazi, popularly known by his stage name, Kwesta has released his much-anticipated music video for "Spirit" on YouTube, "Spirit" was released late last year, and the song gained a lot of traction amongst local and international audiences because of the artist feature by US rapper Wale. The documentary-style music video was filmed in Kwesta's hometown, Katlehong and categorically features the local culture of the township like the brass bands, Zionist churches, and traditional medicine practitioners (sangomas).  Its political nuances reflect a country's rebirth and the old apartheid flag is shown and burnt, visuals that also bring the attention of the viewer to the current flare-ups of protests in South Africa. The video artistically brings back to life a portrait of a woman carrying a child which adorned the walls of many black family homes. It also shines the spotlight on how laundry was done in any given home in the township, as well as a splash of how children used to use buckets to cool each other during summer. The director of the music video, Tebogo Malope, has received unanimous congratulations on social media for the excellent visual articulation of black culture. eNCA
