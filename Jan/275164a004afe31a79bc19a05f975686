EASTERN CAPE: The court has ruled against Winnie Madikizela-Mandela in her bid to obtain land in Qunu, held by the estate of her late ex-husband, former president Nelson Mandela. Madikizela-Mandela was seeking ownership of part of Mandela’s Qunu homestead, which he bequeathed to a family trust for the use of his widow, Graca Machel and the Mandela family. READ: Winnie's legal battle for Qunu The court dismissed Madikizela-Mandela’s appeal on the grounds that there was an unreasonable delay in instituting legal action. She believes a decision taken by the Minister of Land Affairs in 1997, in which the land was donated to the former president, should be set aside. She claims the property was built on land allocated to her in 1989. Mandela's grandson Mandla Mandela has welcomed the decision. The small, rural village of Qunu is where Nelson Mandela was born, raised and laid to rest. eNCA
