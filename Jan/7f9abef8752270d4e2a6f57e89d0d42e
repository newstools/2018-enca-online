POLOKWANE - Kaizer Chiefs had to rely on two second half goals to beat a plucky Baroka FC 2-1 in an action-packed Absa Premiership match played at the Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane on Sunday afternoon. Baroka opened the scoring against the run of play in the 31st minute when midfielder Talent Chawapiwa unleashed a left-foot power shot which rebounded off the Chiefs upright, falling perfectly for striker Lucky Nguzana to slot the ball home. Whatever Chiefs coach Steve Khompela said to the Amakhosi players at half-time certainly did the trick, as it took the visitors just two minutes to level the score. From a throw-in, veteran midfielder Siphiwe Tshabalala left-footed the ball into the penalty area where striker Ryan Moon beat his marker to score with a well-timed header.

Chiefs fans waited patiently for their big-name signing from Mamelodi Sundowns, in the form of Leonardo Castro, to enter the fray in the second half, and the Colombian didn't disappoint, as he scored with his left foot past Baroka's Namibian international goalkeeper Virgil Vries in the 84th minute. Chiefs, now with three wins and a draw in the past four league outings, move to third spot on the league table (behind Mamelodi Sundowns and Cape Town City) with 29 points from 18 games, and will begin preparations for their next league encounter, at home to Sundowns on Saturday. Early season log-leaders Baroka, who remain on 25 points from 18 matches, have possibly the poorest recent statistics in the league having won just two of their past nine games, but will be hoping for a better showing when they play Golden Arrows in Durban next Sunday.
