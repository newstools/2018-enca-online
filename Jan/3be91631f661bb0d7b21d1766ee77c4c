VEREENIGING – Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga accompanied by Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi visited Hoërskool Overvaal in Vereeniging on Monday. This followed skirmishes and rubber bullets outside the school last week over language policy. There was a heavy police presence at the school on Monday as protestors gathered for a fourth academic day to voice their frustration. Last week, a number of protestors were arrested outside the facility for public violence following clashes. A police van was also allegedly petrol bombed by the protestors.
