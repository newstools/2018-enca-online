JOHANNESBURG - Deputy Public Enterprises Minister Ben Martins has clarified the circumstances around a private plane chartered by the Gupta family landing at the Waterkloof Airforce Base in 2013. He says the family wanted government to allow a welcoming ceremony with song and dance as their guests disembarked. "The permission sought here was that when their plane lands, is it possible for a welcoming ceremony. My response was that it can't happen, you can't have song and dance in front of the plane as people get out and I suggested that there is an airport closer to Sun City, it was a smaller airport and they might be able to organise a ceremony, but it can't happen at OR Tambo,‚Äù Martins said.

It has since emerged that the Vrede Dairy Farm in the Free State, meant to benefit poor black farmers, was used to syphon funds from the provincial government in order to pay for the same wedding. eNCA
