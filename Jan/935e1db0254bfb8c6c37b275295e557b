JOHANNESBURG - The late pop singer Brenda Fassie's upcoming biopic is at the centre of controversy between her producer and son. According to reports by TimesLive, Sello 'Chicco' Twala who was the singer's producer at the time of her death, is allegedly standing in the way of the upcoming film about the singer. The late singer's son Bongani Fassie, has spoken out about Twala's attempts to claim all rights to his mother's music legacy. The heated feud, which has now been taken to social media, Twala questioned Fassie's actions and came short of calling him a 'monster and a liar'.
