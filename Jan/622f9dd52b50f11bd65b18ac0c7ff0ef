JOHANNESBURG - Former Western Cape Premier and Cape Town Mayor Gerald Morkel died on Tuesday, a councillor close to the family confirmed to eNCA. Morkel, born on 2 February 1941, served as a Cape councillor for the Democratic Alliance (DA). He retired from political life in the 2011, as a member of the Steenberg municipality. Morkel was in 1984 elected to the Tricameral Parliament, the Coloureds-only House of Representatives during apartheid, on a Labour Party ticket but in 1994, he defected to the National Party (NP). Subsequently, Morkel was appointed NP provincial head and in 1998, he became premier. In the general elections of 1999, no political party obtained a clear majority in the Western Cape. The NP, then the New National Party (NNP), formed a coalition with the Democratic Party (DP now DA), with Morkel remaining premier. A plan to merge under the DA flopped when in 2001, then-NNP leader Marthinus van Schalkwyk revealed the party had pulled out the coalition and subsequently joined the African National Congress (ANC). The Cape politician was extremely critical of the move and even tried to lobby party officials to oppose this. Morkel moved to the DA, where he was appointed Cape Town mayor. He stayed in office for under a year, when the DA was booted by an ANC-NNP coalition following floor crossing in 2002. The politician continued for a while as provincial leader but eventually stepped down due to his links to German fugitive and tax fraudster Jurgen Harksen. eNCA
