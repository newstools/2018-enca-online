JOHANNESBURG – The African National Congress (ANC) is pleased with the commission of inquiry into state capture, newly-elected party leader Cyril Ramaphosa said on Sunday. However, he says the governing party is yet to discuss the probe's terms of reference. "The issue of the appointment of the commission of inquiry has to be welcomed and as the ANC, we applaud President Jacob Zuma for finally appointing the commission. I see it as a simple matter that requires simple discussion and then the matter is taken forward."

The new ANC president said the state capture probe should focus on the more pressing matters. "There are those calling for a broadening of the commission and going back to 1994. Some are saying go back to 1948 when the National Party came in… Don't delay it, wrong things have been done that are known by people who are known - and those are the ones we must investigate." *You can catch that full interview on eNCA at 8pm on 14 January 2018 on DSTV channel 403. eNCA
