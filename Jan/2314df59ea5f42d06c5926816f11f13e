JOHANNESBURG - Dr Barney Selebano, who approved the transfer of Life Esidimeni patients to unregistered NGOs where over 140 of them died, has resigned as head of Gauteng's Department of Health. WATCH: Selebano continues testimony at Esidimeni In December, Selebano apologised for his role in the Life Esidimeni tragedy. This was after saying there was nothing he could have done to stop the transfer of patients to unlicensed NGOs. In November, he lodged an urgent application in the South Gauteng High Court to set aside a subpoena instructing him to testify at the Life Esidimeni arbitration hearings. The court rejected his request. eNCA
