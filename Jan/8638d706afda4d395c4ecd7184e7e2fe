JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng police have confirmed to eNCA that rubber bullets were fired at an H&M store at the East Rand Mall on Saturday. No injuries have been reported. H&M has closed several stores across Gauteng following the protests. Members of the Economic Freedom Front (EFF) attacked H&M stores across the country on Saturday in protest against a racist advert by the company. The retailer used a black child to model a sweatshirt with the slogan "coolest monkey in the jungle". It’s since removed the online advert. READ: ‘Racist’ H&M sweater ad ruffles feathers eNCA
