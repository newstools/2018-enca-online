CAPE TOWN - AgriSA has warned Western Cape farmers who extract and use water unlawfully to expect "severe compliance and enforcement action". In a statement, the group said that it held frank meetings with the Department of Water Affairs and Sanitation earlier in January, to discuss the province's water crisis. The Western Cape is expected to run out of water before the end of April. One of the discussions was around the need for improved water use management, including by farmers. However, AgriSA said it was important not to blame the agriculture sector in the Western Cape for the drought or for the continuing decline in dam levels, even though the sector is the largest consumer of water. IN NUMBERS: What it's going to take to stick to Cape Town's water limits The province "is probably South Africa’s most important export province in terms of agricultural products, or that the food-processing sector represents some 25 percent of the overall manufacturing sector output of South Africa," AgriSA's head of natural resources, Janse Rabie said. "Also forgotten is that agriculture and agro-processing are responsible for 18 percent of employment opportunities in the province and that agri-tourism in the Western Cape is a significant generator of foreign and locally-derived revenue." The organisation said it looks forward to working with Water Affairs minister Nomvula Mokonyane to deal with the effects of the drought. Wine farmers struggle With the province's wine industry suffering in the persisting scorching temperatures, it has been forced to raise its economic growth through increased exports. Despite this, volumes are down, thus impacting bottom lines,resulting in layoffs. *View the attached video for more on the state of the wine industry. eNCA
