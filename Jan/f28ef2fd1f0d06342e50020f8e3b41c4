JOHANNESBURG - Trumpeter and singer Hugh Masekela, known as the "father of South African jazz" who used his music in the fight against apartheid, has died from prostate cancer, his family said on Tuesday. He was 78. pic.twitter.com/fWVByzxwAR In a career spanning more than five decades, Masekela gained international recognition with his distinctive Afro-Jazz sound and hits such as "Soweto Blues", which served as one of the soundtracks to the anti-apartheid movement. Following the end of white-minority rule, he opened the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup Kick-Off Concert and performed at the event's opening ceremony in Johannesburg's Soccer City stadium. "Hughâ€™s global and activist contribution to and participation in the areas of music, theatre, and the arts, in general, is contained in the minds and memory of millions," a statement on behalf of the Masekela family said. "Rest in power beloved, you are forever in our hearts."

South African President Jacob Zuma said the nation would mourn a man who "kept the torch of freedom alive". His global appeal hit new heights in 1968 when his instrumental single "Grazin' in the Grass" went to number one in the US charts. As well as close friendships with jazz legends like Miles Davis, John Coltrane and Charlie Mingus, Masekela also performed alongside stars Janis Joplin, Otis Redding and Jimi Hendrix in the 1960s. He was married to singer and activist Miriam Makeba, known as "Mama Africa", from 1964 to 1966. AFP
