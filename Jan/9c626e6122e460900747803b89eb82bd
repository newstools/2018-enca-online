JOHANNESBURG - A psychologist is urging parents to be more supportive during the release of matric exam results. Psychologist Bradley Daniels says matriculants need systemic support, meaning families need to be aware that this is a very stressful time for pupils as they await their results. Private school results from the Independent Examinations Board (IEB) were released on Wednesday. The Basic Education Minister will on Thursday evening announce the overall results, with government school pupils receiving their individual results early Friday.
