JOHANNESBURG - Former Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu referred on Monday to her training in detonating grenades and dismantling AK47s. Families attending the Esidimeni hearings, as well as people watching or listening to her testimony, were left perplexed as to the relevance of the comment to the hearing. Qedani is testifying at the hearing into the deaths of 143 mentally ill patients after they were moved from the Life Esidimeni hospital to facilities run by non-governmental organisations, most of them unlicensed.

Some of the people present at hearing responded volubly to this, at which point Justice Dikgang Moseneke stopped Mahlangu and instructed the audience not to shout at her. There was no further mention of her arms training, except on Twitter: eNCA
