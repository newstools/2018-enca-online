JOHANNESBURG - Ajax Cape Town will host Mamelodi Sundowns in an Absa Premiership encounter at Cape Town Stadium on Tuesday night with three points and the last laugh up for grabs. Downs, who currently top the league table found themselves knee-deep in smack talk from the Urban Warriors on Tuesday morning. The Cape side took aim at Sundowns on Monday on the back of midfielder Samuel Julies' transfer from Chippa United. Ajax, who sit second from the bottom, carved out a bit of a reputation in 2016, and took a jab at Sundowns: “The Wifi comes and goes at Cape Town Stadium, so we suggest you load some data to tweet about your defeat this evening.” Needless to say, the jab did not go unnoticed on social media and quickly went viral with Masandawana caught completely unaware. After a day of heated social media banter, the stakes have undoubtedly skyrocketed and the question remains whose camp will have a better Wednesday morning. Kick-off is set for 7:30 pm. eNCA
