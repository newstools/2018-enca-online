JOHANNESBURG - The ANC Military Veterans Association's Kebby Maphatsoe is denying any links to the Estina Dairy Farm corruption scandal. Maphatsoe says reports that he has links with the farm is an attempt at tarnishing his image. READ: Maphatsoe sticks to his guns to honour controversial public figures "I don’t have any relationship with that Vrede farm. I don’t know where it is, I don’t have a company that deals with it. Parliament would have punished me, it’s just a sorry that people are trying to deal with you they will come up with anything, " says Maphatsoe. On Saturday the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said it has seized the Gupta-linked Estina diary farm in Vrede in the Free State in a bid to recoup up to R1.6-billion in looted funds. The NPA said Atul Gupta's personal bank account will also be frozen. It said he had received proceeds of crime in cash. eNCA
