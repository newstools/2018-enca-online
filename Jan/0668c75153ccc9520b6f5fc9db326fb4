JOHANNESBURG - The chairperson of the portfolio committee on police, Francois Beukman, has welcomed the announcement on Wednesday of an agreement between the police minister and the suspended head of crime intelligence, Lieutenant-General Richard Mdluli, that he be relieved of his duties. In a statement, Parliament says: “Lieutenant-General Mdluli’s discharge will enable police management to appoint a permanent leader with the requisite skills, energy and innovative plans to guide the division to deliver on its mandate. The stability brought by the appointment of a permanent leader is essential if the unit is to add value in intelligence-driven policing.” Mdluli had been suspended from the police since March 2011 and been paid to sit at home for nearly seven years. He and former policeman Mthembeni Mthunzi are accused of kidnapping and killing the husband of Mdluli's ex-girlfriend in 1999. Police Minister Fikile Mbalula insists the exit of Mdluli and of axed Hawks head Berning Ntlemeza – both regarded as loyal supporters of President Jacob Zuma – was not linked to Cyril Ramaphosa’s election as ANC President. The Institute for Security Studies (ISS) has welcomed Mdluli's removal. There have been 12 acting heads of crime intelligence since Mdluli's suspension. According to Johan Burger, ISS senior researcher: "Most of those individuals who acted in those positions did not come from crime intelligence. They had no background, no expertise in the function of that division." He says this contributed to a lack of trust in crime intelligence and caused a breakdown in the ability of the division to function fully. "The uncertainty and lack of trust between members, and of course the absence of good solid intelligence for the other operational units within the police service where they relied on crime intelligence, was not forthcoming. I think we saw this in the huge rise in crime levels, especially violent crimes in the last five years," says Burger. eNCA
