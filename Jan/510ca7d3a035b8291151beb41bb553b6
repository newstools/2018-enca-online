JOHANNESBURG - International clothing brand H&M has been in hot water since it launched an advert that showed a black boy wearing a sweater written "coolest monkey in the jungle." The racial undertones in the advert caused outrage on social media, with general users, bloggers, and celebrities calling for a boycott of the brand. The biggest blow was dealt by Canadian Grammy award winner, The Weeknd, who said he was shocked and embarrassed by the picture of the boy. The Weeknd had been in collaboration with the Swedish brand on his clothing label, XO and had performed on their fashion shows.  The chain retail store has since apologised and removed the ad, they also posted new 'politically correct' images which didn't suffice.  eNCA
