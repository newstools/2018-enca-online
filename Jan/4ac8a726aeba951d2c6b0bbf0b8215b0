DETROIT - A former Fiat Chrysler executive has pleaded guilty in federal court for his role in a scheme to raid more than a million dollars from a union fund meant for worker training. Alphons Iacobelli, former Fiat Chrysler US labour relations chief, has pleaded guilty to two charges related to a conspiracy to syphon money from the fund operated jointly by the company and the United Auto Workers union. Iacobelli will be sentenced May 29 and could face up to 96 months in prison. He pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate the Labor Management Relations Act and for submitting a false tax return. The former executive was at the centre of a multi-year conspiracy investigated by the US Justice Department, which damaged the reputations of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and the union, which already was struggling to maintain its dominance in the industry, after suffering defeats in efforts to unionize plants in the South. The government charged four people with syphoning off funds for personal use. In all, officials said more than $1.5 million in worker training funds were diverted over a five-year period ending in 2014, aimed at influencing union officials in favour of the company, according to the plea agreement. Iacobelli, who from 2008 to 2015 was the company's lead labour negotiator, said he was "acting on behalf of Fiat Chrysler." He spent money on a second-hand Ferrari, collectable Mont Blanc fountain pens and an extensive list of renovations to his home. He also admitted he authorized more than $450,000 in credit card charges for jewellery, furniture, electronics and other luxuries for FCA UAW members And $262,219 in training centre funds were used to pay off the mortgage of former UAW vice president General Holiefield, who died in 2015. On the tax charge, Iacobelli said he omitted more than $840,000 in income in 2014, obtained illegally through FCA funds. AFP
