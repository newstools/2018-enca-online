PHILADELPHIA - American rapper Kiari Cephus, popularly known as Offset has come under the spotlight for his controversial verse in a music video. He was guest featured on YFN Lucci's track Boss Life where he delivered the damning statement that landed him on a negative stance with fans. In the video, the rapper said 'I cannot vibe with no queers', which attracted backlash and criticism. The phrase in the verse landed him in hot water with social media users, who called him out on his ignorance and lack of knowledge of the fashion industry and it being influenced by many queer designers. He has since apologised for the verse by first denying that he wrote the verse and later saying that he was only looking for a word to rhyme with in his delivery. Watch the video here: Offset saying he doesn’t vibe with queers while constantly wearing and PARADING clothes by gay designers is the REAL gag. all i’m saying is if you’re a homophobe say it with your chest.
