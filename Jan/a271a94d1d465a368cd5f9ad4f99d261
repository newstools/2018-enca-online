Hawks spokesman Hangwani Mulaudzi said they were looking specifically for documents. The Hawks are expected to meet with the intended beneficiaries of the project on Saturday. The Director-General of the Free State Provincial Government, Kopung Ralikontsane, confirmed to OFM that the Hawks have served them with a search warrant. He also confirmed that the raids relate to the Vrede Dairy project's investigations. Ralikontsane says the provincial government is corporating with the Hawks. Former ANC Free State provincial secretary, William Bulwane, as said the raids do not mean that anyone has been found guilty of a criminal offense. Bulwane says the raids on the offices of the premier and the provincial Agriculture Department are being blown out of proportion. The ANC wants the law to takes its course before the party takes action against Ace Magashule. According to Khusela Diko, ANC Communications Manager, it is not fair to "cast doubt or aspersions" on any ANC officials while law enforcement agencies are still investigating.
