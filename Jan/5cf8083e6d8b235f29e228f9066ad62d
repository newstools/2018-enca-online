JOHANNESBURG – Following the signing of three new players during the current midseason transfer window period, Kaizer Chiefs announced the promotion of Siphosakhe Ntiya-Ntiya from the club’s development structures. Ntiya-Ntiya, 21, was born in the Eastern Cape town of Bizana. He joined the Kaizer Chiefs development in 2016. He plays in the left back position. Football Manager Bobby Motaung congratulated and welcomed Siphosakhe to the senior team.  “We have been looking at his progress and we are satisfied with what we’ve seen,” said Motaung. “He trained with the senior team a few times in 2017 and we believe a player of his quality is ready for the big stage.” “While it’s important to reinforce the team with players from other teams, it’s important to recognise the wealth of young talent we have in our development structure,” Motaung added. Ntiya-Ntiya who says his role model is Tsepo Masilela, is part of the 20-man team that will travel to Nelspruit to face SuperSport United on Saturday for Amakhosi’s first Absa Premiership match of 2018. “I am grateful and excited for this opportunity and will grab it with both hands. I’ve been working hard and I am happy that my perseverance has paid off,” says Ntiya-Ntiya. The club wishes the player all the best for the remainder of the season and beyond. African News Agency
