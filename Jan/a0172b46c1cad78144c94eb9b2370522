The group, known for its wildly popular Honour of KingsÂ video game and ubiquitous WeChat social media platform, Thursday offered four tranches with maturities ranging from five to 20 years, according to the financial news agency.

Tencent's last bond issue raised $2.5-billion in 2015. Its e-book arm China Literature raised $1.1-billion for a Hong Kong listing in November 2017. The new deal is similar to one in November by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, which raised $7-billion in an issue reserved for US institutional investors.
