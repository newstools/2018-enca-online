JOHANNESBURG - While the DA blamed the EFF for the stampede at the Capricorn TVET College, the EFF Students Command has put the blame squarley on the college's management. It says the management did not keep to the agreement in dealing with applications. The EFF has vowed to stay put until all students are helped.

Since we've agreed with the management that they must by today finish with the old students, start with the new students," says William Sathekge, EFF Students Command. "So it really shows that the management of this campus are almost failing the people of South Africa by not adhering to the agreement," he says But Capricorn TVET College's Public Relations Officer, Tumelo Morobe, says management cannot be blamed for the stampede at the institution. “It’s can’t be management’s responsibility because we had planned very well for today for registration. Before we could even start working there was already a stampede by the gate. People were coming in late pushing one another and there were also casualties. We had to deal with the causalities instead of what we had planned to do today.”)) At least six people were injured during the stampede. Registration at the college will now resume on Monday. eNCA
