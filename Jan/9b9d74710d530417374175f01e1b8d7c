CAPE TOWN - Western Cape Premier Helen Zille met with principals and teachers from the province on Wednesday to present the plan for schools ahead of Day Zero. Day Zero, as officials have dubbed it, is the day which the city runs out of water. At the meeting, Zille assured them that schools would not run out. According to Zille, there is a 60% chance Day Zero will be reached, although it can be avoided. eNCA
