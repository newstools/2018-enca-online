SAO PAULO - Brazilian soccer great Pele has collapsed with exhaustion and been forced to cancel a long-planned trip to London this weekend, the Football Writers Association (FWA) said on Friday. The FWA was due to host a dinner in his honour at the Savoy hotel on Sunday but said the 77-year-old would not make it.
