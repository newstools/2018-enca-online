JOHANNESBURGÂ  - Former Prasa CEO Lucky Montana might have faced a grilling from Parliament's inquiry into state capture at state-owned enterprises on Tuesday, but Twitter was delighted by the number of bombshells dropped and people thrown under the proverbial bus. Montana claimed that then-transport minister Ben Martins introduced him to the controversial Gupta family in 2012. During his testimony, Montana implicated a number of people besides the Guptas, including the former transport minister Dipuo Peters, ANC treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize, Gupta-associate Salima Essa, President Jacob Zuma's son Duduzane and New Age Media owner, Mzwanele 'Jimmy' Manyi. Zahara's name was also dropped as Montana tried to emphasise one of his points. eNCA
