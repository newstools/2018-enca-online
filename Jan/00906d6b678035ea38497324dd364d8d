JOHANNESBURG – The Higher Education Transformation Network says it will be taking the Council for Higher Education (CHE) to court over its decision of de-accredit Walter Sisulu University (WSU)’s LLB legal degree. The network says it requested a meeting with the CHE two years ago to discuss the matter, but to no response from the council. “The CHE neither acknowledged nor granted our request for a meeting with regards to above matter,” a statement released by the network read.

"We remain confident that our legal action on the matter will yield justice." eNCA
