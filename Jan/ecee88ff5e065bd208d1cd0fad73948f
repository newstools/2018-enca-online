JOHANNESBURG - The JSE closed lower on Monday‚ as global risk-off sentiment ensured a sharp sell-off in banking‚ financial and property stocks‚ while global diversified miners gained on the weaker rand. Local factors were also at play. Eskom will publish its delayed interim financial results on Tuesday‚ ahead of a JSE warning that could see its bond listings suspended after January 31. “Markets seem to be a bit wary in anticipation of Eskom’s financial results‚” said Peregrine Treasury analyst Bianca Botes. This caution puts into perspective the dire straits SA still found itself in as a result of weak economic fundamentals‚ she said. The rand weakened through R12 to the dollar for the first time in a week‚ before recovering marginally‚ as the latter bounced back from three-year lows against the euro. Profit-taking was the order of the day. Some local stocks have been delivering sterling results for local and foreign investors for quite some time.

General retailers returned 7.6 percent in January following that of 12.6 percent in December. “FirstRand is up 31.5 percent since mid-November‚ or 60 percent in dollar terms‚” Stanlib said. Property stocks were particularly hard hit on Monday‚ as local bond yields spiked in line with a weakening in the US bond market‚ which saw the 10-year hit its highest yield since mid-2014. Property stocks are closely linked to the bond market in respect of yields and financing. The big diversified miners kept their heads above water‚ shielded by a weaker rand‚ which more than offset relatively weaker commodity prices.
