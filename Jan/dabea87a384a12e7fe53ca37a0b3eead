JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) National Executive Committee (NEC) member, Bheki Cele, says President Jacob Zuma’s fate rests in the hands of the party’s highest decision-making body. Outspoken Cele says a cabinet reshuffle is inevitable as new ideas and thinking following last month's conference need to be accommodated. Cele has spoken exclusively with eNCA’s Siphamandla Goge.

The former National Police Commissioner believes change must come and emphasised that the President was ultimately held to account by the governing party.  WATCH: Archbishop Makgoba calls for Zuma recall in Midnight Mass Cele says when the newly-elected NEC meets for the first time next week one of its immediate tasks will be looking at problems in KwaZulu-Natal. It's expected to appoint an inclusive provincial task team to administer the party's political affairs in its biggest province.  eNCA
