JOHANNESBURG - The Johannesburg Metro Police Department has arrested a man it believes is involved in a fake money scheme. Officers pulled the suspect over on the Heidelberg Road for a routine road check. In the car, they found R30,000 in cash. Led to a small backroom elsewhere by the suspect, officers discovered about R300,000 in forged notes. They also found a printing machine, a paper compressor and other apparatus needed to make fake money. The police also found notes in foreign currencies. According to JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar: “This illegal operation has been taking place for a long time because we saw the cut-offs of a lot of paper in plastic bags which were in this room." Police said this might be part of a bigger operation. The suspect is in police custody and will be charged with money laundering and possession of counterfeit money. eNCA
