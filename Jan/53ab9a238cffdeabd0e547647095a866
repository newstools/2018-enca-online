PORT ELIZABETH – Chippa United and Golden Arrows played to a goalless draw in a mid-table Premiership tussle at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Sunday afternoon. Both sides, who made an encouraging start to the season last year before a marked slide down the table, would ideally have liked to use Sunday’s fixture to make some headway, but had to settle for a share of the spoils in a match which did neither side’s cause any good. Much of the action took place in midfield as both sides generally lacked cohesion and struggled to put together the finishing touches in what eventually deteriorated into a scrappy encounter featuring a number of stoppages. If anything, the hosts had the better of the first half exchanges and looked more threatening, but failed to breach an organised Arrows defence, with goalkeeper Nkosingiphile Gumede also snuffing out a few promising looking opportunities. With a point a piece gained, neither side managed to improve on their log positions and the Chilli Boys remain in eighth place, with Abafana Bes’thende staying rooted to 10th. African News Agency
