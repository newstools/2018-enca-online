She was addressing the Cape Town Press Club on Sunday. It’s predicted the City of Cape Town will run out of water on 12 April. "I can stand here and say Day Zero can be avoided if all of us become positive, move beyond politics and appreciate the realities of climate change," said Mokonyane. She said Capetonians must be updated on innovative ways to save even more water. February's level 6-B restrictions will force residents to reduce their consumption to just 50 litres per person, per day. Earlier in the morning, the Muslim Judicial Council has held a prayer for rain in Cape Town.
