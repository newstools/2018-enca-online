JOHANNESBURG - UK authorities on Monday announced an investigation into KPMG's audits of the collapsed British construction company, Carillion. The country’s Financial Reporting Council wants to probe whether ethical and technical standards for auditors were breached. Carillion went under earlier this month, with debt sitting at over 1.6-billion pounds (R26.9-billion).
