NORTH WEST - Taxi operators and residents in the North West town of Rustenburg warn the time for drug dealers in their area is running out. At least six properties, believed to be drug dens and brothels, were set alight on Wednesday. This was sparked by, among others, the arrest of a police officer found with a known drug dealer. The situation is calm but uneasy, and police continue patrolling the streets. At a meeting with local municipal officials, taxi operators agree they will not resort to violence, but they want the area cleared of drugs. Officials admit the drug problem is out of control. They say at least 25 brothels and drug dens have already been shut down. eNCA
