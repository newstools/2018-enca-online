PORT ELIZABETH – Two armed gunmen held up security guards at the Port Elizabeth Airport early on Tuesday morning and got away with an undisclosed amount of cash. It is understood the business robbery took place at the Acsa offices opposite the Wimpy restaurant. Police spokesperson Colonel Pricilla Naidu said that at about 5:30am, two employees were fetching money from the ticket machines at the airport when they were robbed of the cash and their cellphones.
