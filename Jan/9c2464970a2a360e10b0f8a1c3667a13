JOHANNESBURG - South Africa reached 6/1, still trailing by 181 runs in the first innings, at the close of play of day one of the third Test against India at the Wanderers, in Johannesburg, on Wednesday. Oh but this KG Rabada and Lungi Ngidi thing going on at the Proteas❤️-- pic.twitter.com/2rmNB2tiee On a day of struggle for the batsmen, India were bowled out for 187 in 77 overs and by stumps South Africa had already lost the wicket of Aiden Markram (two) in the six overs they faced. The Indian total, after Virat Kohli had won the toss, was built around an 84-run partnership for the third wicket between the Indian captain (54 off 106 balls, nine fours) and Cheteshwar Pujara (50 off 179 balls, eight fours) followed by some spirited hitting from the lower order of whom Bhuvneshwar Kumar made 30 (49 balls, 4 fours). The Proteas lead the Sunfoil Freedom Trophy Test series 2-0 after victories in Cape Town and Centurion in the first two Tests. The 3rd Test starts in Wanderers today. Do you see a whitewash or an India come back?

Quinton de Kock had a great day behind the stumps with five catches to equal the SA record for Tests against India held jointly by Dave Richardson, Mark Boucher (twice) and AB de Villiers. Where the Proteas will feel they could have done better is that they gave Kohli two lives on 11 and 32 and they can be grateful that it did not cost them more runs against a batsman who nearly always converts half-centuries into three-figure scores.
