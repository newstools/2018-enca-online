JOHANNESBURG - ANC Johannesburg regional deputy secretary Dan Bovu has been charged with fraud and theft at the Lenasia South police station. He is expected to appear in the Commercial Crimes Court in Johannesburg on Wednesday. READ: ANC councillor Bovu denies bribery allegations The charges relate to bribes apparently received in exchange for the illegal sale of city-owned land in a case dating back to 2006. Bovu informed the Gauteng ANC about his pending case about a week ago, according to officials, but the party in the province maintains he is innocent, until proven otherwise. Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba has meanwhile called on the Gauteng ANC to remove Bovu as a city councillor. In 2016, Bovu threatened to sue the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) for defamation after the party claimed he tried to bribe its councillors to vote with the ANC after elections. Bovu, at the time, stated the EFF’s allegations were desperate attempts at political “grandstanding". eNCA
