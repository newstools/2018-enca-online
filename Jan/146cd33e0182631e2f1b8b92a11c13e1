CAPE TOWN - The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) is calling on all spheres of government to help deal with the water crisis. The commission says it's monitoring the situation to ensure the City of Cape Town and other supporting parties work together. The arrival of Day Zero is imminent. Research suggests Capetonians will have no water come April. The SAHRC met with city officials on Friday who said the measures in place are in residents' best interest.

Meanwhile, there appears to be a feud between Western Cape Premier Helen Zille and Water Affairs Minister Nomvula Mokonyane around the water crisis. The pair has been at loggerheads regarding when exactly the province's water problems were declared a disaster. On Friday, Zille walked out of a meeting after Mokonyane arrived 30 minutes late. The two have different views on how to avoid the taps running dry. eNCA
