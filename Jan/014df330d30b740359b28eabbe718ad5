KWAZULU-NATAL - The African National Congress (ANC) kicked off the year on a bullish note in KwaZulu-Natal as the party marked its 106th anniversary. ANC officials laid a wreath at the gravesite of the founding president of the ANC, John Dube, visited ANC president Albert Luthuli's gravesite, visited schools and churches as well as Zulu King Goodwill Zwelintini, who gave the governing party's newly-elected president, Cyril Ramaphosa, a bull as a gift.
