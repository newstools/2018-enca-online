JOHANNESBURG – Gavin Hunt saw his Bidvest Wits side ending their nightmare run of seven league games without a win with a well-deserved 2-0 victory over SuperSport United at the Bidvest Stadium on Wednesday night. The defeat, meanwhile, means that the Pretoria team, coached by former Wits player and coach Eric Tinkler, have now also gone seven matches without a win in the premiership. The two goals, from Bongani Khumalo and James Keene, came in the first 20 minutes of a match in which almost all of the noteworthy action took place in the opening stanza. The home side looked dangerous from the start and were close to scoring after only three minutes when Lehlohonolo Majoro’s header was kept out by United keeper Reyaad Pieterse, with the rebound rattling the woodwork.

Sniffing blood, the Clever Boys kept their foot on SuperSport’s throat and doubled their lead just three minutes later when James Keene brushed off Azubuike Egwuekwe before blazing past Pietersen at the near post from an acute angle. The home side had more first half chances, but Majoro headed over the bar before Khumalo had his snap-shot saved by the feet of Pietersen. SuperSport played themselves back into the game to a certain degree but although they managed to contain Wits, they created very little going forward. For their part, the Students were content to drop the pace and tighten things up in defence, and they kept the Tshwane side at bay with ease as they secured only their third league win of the season to move above Ajax Cape Town and into 15th.
