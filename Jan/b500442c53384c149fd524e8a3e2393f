JOHANNESBURG - Foreign investors have snapped up local shares at a fairly aggressive rate over the past week‚ signalling a change in their perceptions of the local economy. Foreigners bought a net R9.5-billion worth of local equities‚ but ditched local bonds to the tune of R5.3-billion. Over the past couple of, years‚ non-residents have preferred local bonds over equities‚ chasing relatively high returns on offer. But tables appear to have turned since December when the ANC elected Cyril Ramaphosa as its new leader‚ paving the way for him to potentially become head of state if the party wins general elections in 2019.

Strong equity inflows also coincided with optimism over synchronised global growth‚ which encouraged investors to pile into risky assets. Stanlib analyst Paul Hansen said in an e-mailed note last week that 2018 was likely to see a broadening of the bull market on the JSE‚ meaning that more shares would gain in value due to a stronger rand‚ lower inflation and a better economy. iNet Bridge
