JOHANNESBURG - Social media was abuzz on Monday, following a racial controversy about a recently-launched clothing line for children by retailer H&M. The advert appeared on the retail companyâ€™s United Kingdom website. The H&M boy's clothing catalogue shows a black boy modelling a sweater that refers to him as a monkey. On the adjacent page, a white boy is shown wearing one that calls him a 'survival expert', which caused furore on social media, with some users labelling it as 'racist', 'offensive' and 'distasteful'. UK publication The Evening Standard said H&M had apologised for the ad and removed it from its website. After causing a lot of controversy for putting black boy in a hoodie that says "coolest monkey in the jungle"... H&M deleted the picture on their UK website. pic.twitter.com/K1vO55RD7I Those H&M designers really all sat there and thought having a black kid model a hoodie that says "Coolest Monkey in the Jungle" was a good idea. Smh. https://t.co/9fH6t32fhd eNCA
