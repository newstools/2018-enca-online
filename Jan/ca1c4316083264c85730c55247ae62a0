CAPE TOWN â€“ Seamer Vernon Philander took career-best figures as rampant South Africa claimed a 72-run victory over India in a gripping first test at Newlands on Monday. Set 208 for victory, India were skittled for 135 in 42, 4 overs in their second innings on a lively wicket with Philander the chief destroyer, recording figures of 6-42 for his first five-wicket haul in tests since 2013.

South Africa are hosting India in a three-test series this month, with matches to come in Pretoria, starting on Saturday, and Johannesburg. eNCA
