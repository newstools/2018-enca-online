JOHANNESBURG - Chris Paisley of England defied the odds near Johannesburg on Sunday to win the South African Open, his maiden European Tour triumph. The 31-year-old carded a six-birdie final-round 66 at sun-drenched Glendower Golf Club for a total of 267 and a three-stroke victory over Branden Grace of South Africa, who shot a 68. Grace trailed Paisley by one shot entering the final round, but was expected to triumph given his far higher world ranking of 30, much greater experience and huge home support.

But the Englishman ranked 289 in the world held his nerve and moved into a two-shot lead by the sixth, which the 29-year-old South African double-bogeyed.

He did find a bunker at 15, but got down in two, effectively closing the door on any chance Grace had of halting a great English run in the South African Open. Andy Sullivan won the event in 2015 and Graeme Storm last year, leaving Paisley to make it three victories in four editions for English golfers.
