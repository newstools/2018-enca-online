CAPE TOWN – Western Cape Disaster Management was dealing with a dangerous Oleum chemical spill in the Kranskop area near Wellington on Thursday afternoon. Oleum is a fuming sulphuric acid used for transportation, organic chemistry research and for manufacturing explosives. Cape Winelands Fire Services had a team on site who were assessing the problem and attending to it. Provincial environmental affairs officials were also responding to the incident. According to authorities, there was a concern that a gas cloud may form and wind patterns indicate such a cloud may move into the direction of Groenberg Valley. By Thursday afternoon, fire services advised that the acid leak was "fully under control" and that the acid plume/cloud had "diminished substantially." No roads were closed. By Thursday evening, authorities confirmed that the leak was fully stabilised and that residents could return to their homes. According to a statement by the Drakenstein Municipality, altogether 306 people residing within a 3km radius of the Rheinmetall Denel Munition outside Wellington, where the spill occurred, were evacuated and a two-month-old baby was admitted to Paarl Hospital. eNCA
