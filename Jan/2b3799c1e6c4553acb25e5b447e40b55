CAPE TOWN - Military and police officers will be deployed to aid in the Cape Town water crisis as ‘Day zero’, the day when taps run dry, edges closer. Western Cape Premier Helen Zille held a briefing in Cape Town about preparations for Day Zero, which is expected to begin in April. Zille confirmed she wrote to President Jacob Zuma, asking him to declare the Western Cape a national disaster area. A lot of questions have been raised by members of the public, experts and environmentalists as to whether enough has been done. It is also being questioned whether officials are adequately prepared. WATCH: Dear Cape Town: you have a problem, Day Zero is real Zille has praised the farming industry for conserving water in Cape Town. As of 1 February, Capetonians will be limited to 50 litres of water per person per day as water restrictions are elevated once again. eNCA
