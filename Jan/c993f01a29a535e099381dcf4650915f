JOHANNESBURG - Satellite television provider Multichoice held a media briefing to address several payments it made to the SABC and ANN7. It announced it would be removing ANN7 from the Dstv bouquet. According to Calvo Mawela, Multichoice CEO: “The board has found the were some mistakes in our dealings with ANN7, but there is no evidence of corruption or any illegal activity. Secondly, we acknowledge that we should have looked into the controversy surrounding ANN7 before public concern was raised and this should have been raised to the board sooner. Thirdly, we will not be renewing our contract with ANN7. Instead, we are going to be hosting a new black owned news channel and we’ll be calling for proposals from interested media groups soon. We will not be renewing ANN7’s contract and the channel will not be broadcast on DSTV once the contract ends on the 20th of August 2018." On Sunday, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa said Mutichoice would be probed.
