JOHANNESBURG - SuperSport United confirmed on Monday that an agreement has been reached on the sale of Jeremy Brockie to Mamelodi Sundowns. The Kiwi striker spent three years at Matsatsantsa after joining from Wellington Phoenix in January 2015. In his time at SuperSport he scored 28 Absa Premiership goals in 81 appearances, 16 domestic cup goals, helping Matsatsantsa lift two Nedbank Cups and an MTN8 title earlier this season and 10 goals in the clubs continental efforts, where SuperSport succeeded in reaching the final of the CAF Confederation Cup for the first time in their history. Club CEO Stanley Matthews said “It’s never easy to lose a key player like Jeremy, especially off the back of three great seasons with us in which we made 5 cup finals and he became the second highest scorer at the club." "We also understand that at his age this is Jeremy’s last big move and opportunity to secure his financial future." "Given that he has made a significant contribution to the club on and off the field our board have agreed to sanction his move to Mamelodi Sundowns and we wish him well in his future.“ eNCA
