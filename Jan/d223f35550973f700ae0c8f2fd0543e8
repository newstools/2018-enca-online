JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma has made a last ditch effort to save himself from prosecution. RT @karynmaughan: BREAKING: President Jacob Zuma’s lawyers filed his representations on why corruption case must not proceed just after 9pm at NPA offices.
		NDPP Shaun Abrahams personally received them. He's filed papers, explaining why he shouldn’t face fraud and corruption charges. National Prosecuting Authority boss Shaun Abrahams was at the NPA’s head office to receive the representations. The original deadline was the 30th of November, but president Zuma received a seven-week extension. Abrahams has given prosecutors two weeks to consider the representations. He'll then decide whether the president will be charged. #Zuma “I’m being arrested just for building my home.” - President Jacob Zuma on Nkandla.
