JOHANNESBURG - A bearish dollar market again provided the JSE with direction on Thursday‚ with gains in most indices being offset by losses by Naspers and other rand hedges.

This was due to ECB head Mario Draghi’s comments regarding the strong Eurozone economy‚ reported Dow Jones Newswires. Woolworths dropped 2.13 percent to R64.27 after having been down as much as 11.7 percent earlier in the day.
