JOHANNESBURG – Certain Transnet executives and board members have been served with notices to appear before Parliament’s Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) on Tuesday and Wednesday. This comes after officials failed to appear before a scheduled hearing with Scopa on 6 December last year. Scopa has since “resolved to subpoena individual members of the executive and board members to appear before the committee to make submissions and answer questions on alleged violations of the Public Finance Management Act of 1999, and contractual deviations and expansions for the 2016/2017 financial year, including the first and second quarters of 2017,” the committee’s statement read.
