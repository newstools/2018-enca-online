SAINT-ETIENNE,Â France - French international winger Paul-Georges Ntep is set to join Saint-Etienne on loan from German side Wolfsburg, a spokesman for the Ligue 1 outfit said on Monday. The 25-year-old, who made two international appearances in 2015, is due in the French city later on Monday for a medical ahead of his loan deal, which will not include an option to buy. Cameroon-born Ntep joined Wolfsburg for five million euros (R75.56 million) last January from Rennes, but failed to score in 15 Bundesliga appearances and has started just once in the league this season. Struggling Saint-Etienne ended a 10-match winless streak in Ligue 1 by beating Toulouse 2-0 on Sunday, but remain only four points above the relegation zone. AFP
