DURBAN - The National Freedom Party (NFP) will hold an elective conference by the end of June. Plagued by factionalism and ongoing court battles, the NFP claims to be re renewing itself ahead of the 2019 elections.                                                                                                               While the NFP managed to win six seats in Parliament in 2014, it missed the IEC’s deadline to pay a deposit to contest the 2016 Local Government Elections.

	“I once again say, without any fear, we are sorry for what happened. It was not our intention,” said Maliyakhe Shelembe, IFP Chairperson.    
	                                                                                      
	“I’m sorry for what happened. The reason I’m saying this is because we were working collectively as the NEC,” said Celo Mabika, FP Deputy National Chairperson. 
	                
	Others are promising to work hard for the party.                                                       “The doomsayers and naysayers who were saying the NFP is dead, they are going to see a renewed, reinvigorated NFP. An NFP that will move gallantly towards the 2019 elections,” said Nhlanhla Khubisa, NFP Secretary.  In a statement read on her behalf, party leader Zanele KaMagwaza-Msibi preached unity.
	                                                                                      
	"Unity is key to what we want to achieve. I implore you to bring together all warring factions so we can win the forthcoming elections and stamp our authority on the political scene in South Africa,” she said.  The party has promised to reveal the names of some political big guns it claims will be joining it soon. eNCA
