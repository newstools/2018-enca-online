JOHANNESBURG – The Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors (IRBA) on Friday said it extended its probe beyond the initial investigation into KPMG’s audits of Linkway Trading and the South African Revenue Service (Sars) rogue unit report. KPMG admitted work done for Gupta-linked Company Linkway Trading and its controversial the South Africa Revenue Service rogue unit report, fell short of its professional standards. The audit firm is being suspected of having passed off wedding expenses as business costs.

"With respect to the SARS matter, the IRBA engaged with the SARS Commissioner and most of the information has been received, subsequently,” Agulhas said. “The IRBA is confident that the additional information will be supplied in due course. “This is consistent with the IRBA’s powers under its Act to request any information necessary to perform its investigations.” The South African Institute of Chartered Accountants has launched a separate investigation.  The IRBA reiterated it had no involvement in that enquiry. eNCA
