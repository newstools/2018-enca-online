JOHANNESBURG - A KwaZulu-Natal businessmanÂ wants the North Gauteng High Court to declare the ANC's national elective conference null and void Vincent Madoda Myeni, who is a ward 32 chairperson in KwaZulu-Natal's Moses Mabhida region, wants members of the party's top six to pay the costs of his application. READ: Timeframe set for ANC KZN provincial conference The ANC has filed an opposing affidavit saying there is no basis for the application. It dismissed on Wednesday Myeni's claim that Gauteng ANC chairman Paul Mashatile was in a romantic relationship with an official of the elections agency that ran the party elections. Myeni claims this is a conflict of interest. The ANC said it had no knowledge of such a relationship and that Mashatile denied having had a child with the woman. Mashatile has reportedly reserved the right to sue Myeni for defamation. The application for the nullification of the conference will be heard on Tuesday. eNCA
