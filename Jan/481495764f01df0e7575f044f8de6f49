JOHANNESBURG - Just days before New York Fashion Week, Kanye West dropped the #YEEZYSEASON6 campaign for his clothing line, Yeezy. The collection featured activations by social media models and influencers modeling the line and posing in identical photos to those from Kim Kardashian West's photoshoots. Kim Kardashian West has been spotted a series of pictures where she was running errands in the latest Yeezy fashion, released by her music mogul husband, Kanye West. The 'Be like Kim' activation included walking down the road, drinking from a cup, eating a Mc Donalds ice cream, as well as getting out of a vintage car. Socialite and DJ, Paris Hilton was spotted in Kim Kay's drag where she wore similar clothes and wore the same hair as Kardashian West. Hilton and Jordyn Woods were amongst the models who participated in the activation.

We're so here for the #YEEZYSEASON6 campaign #SpreeTheThread pic.twitter.com/uPzL6PgV6R Will the real Kim K please stand up? Kanye is a genius for using Kim, and females with presence on social media as promo, free ads and the preview of the #YeezySeason6 collection. Kim has been in all these looks over the last couple months. I love this rollout. pic.twitter.com/MYplpx1Zvk JORDYN DID THAT. #YEEZYSEASON6 pic.twitter.com/mUy0npT4mb Ok but Iâ€™m living 4 #YEEZYSEASON6 pic.twitter.com/73e6H3DHir eNCA
