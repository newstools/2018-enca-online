EAST LONDON - ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa says the party and people of South Africa are desperate for corruption to be dealt with as a matter of urgency. And that’s why he says the terms of reference of the newly established State Capture Inquiry must be crafted in line with Thuli Madonsela’s recommendations. Ramaphosa spoke to eNCA's Dan Moyane on Sunday. According to Ramaphosa, there is only one centre of power for the ANC, that is Luthuli House. Ramaphosa says the governing party's yet to discuss the probe's terms of reference but is pleased with the State Capture commission of inquiry, recently announced by President Jacob Zuma. Ramaphosa says the pledge to renew the governing party and the push for unity will take it back to its roots. According to Ramaphosa, he has more than enough political credentials for his role as party president. Ramaphosa says the issue of free higher education is a delicate matter that should be dealt with in a proper manner. eNCA
