JOHANNESBURG - One of the intended beneficiaries of the Gupta-linked Estina Dairy Project says President Jacob Zuma was among the people who told her organisation they'd benefit from the farm. She says she's so far been a beneficiary only in name.

We are just beneficiaries," she says. On Saturday the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said it has seized the Gupta-linked Estina diary farm in Vrede in the Free State in a bid to recoup up to R1.6-billion in looted funds. It also said Atul Gupta's personal bank account will be frozen. The NPA alleges that he had received proceeds of crime in cash. eNCA
