PORT ELIZABETH - The Nelson Mandela Bay (NMB) Metro police arrested three young men with a homemade shotgun and brought a "hopelessly intoxicated" taxi driver with no licence and an unroadworthy vehicle to book. According to a statement, metro officers were monitoring pick-up points at schools for overloading when they received a complaint that three boys were robbing and threatening schoolchildren at Nooitgedacht and William Slammert roads. “Upon investigation, they arrested three suspects, aged 18, 19 and 24, with a homemade shotgun," said metro police chief Yolande Faro. The 19- and 24-year old suspects were taken to the Gelvandale police station and the third suspect was taken to Stepping Stones Rehabilitation Centre. In another incident, traffic officers noticed a packed taxi driving erratically in Uitenhage Road in the vicinity of Mati Road. When the vehicle was pulled over, it was overloaded with 39 children. “All of the tyres were smooth and the driver had no driver's licence or permits. When he was asked to blow into the breathalyser a reading of 1.24 was measured, which far exceeds the legal limit," said Warren Prins, director: traffic and licensing. The vehicle was impounded and the driver taken to the Algoa Park police station. The taxi association was contacted to arrange alternative transport for the pupils. eNCA
