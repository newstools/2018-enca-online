They're part of a group protesting outside Hoërskool Overvaal, over the school's language policy. According to Tlhoriso Mofokeng of the Committee: "We are not going to allow a segregation of our children based on a language. We are not against the language itself which is Afrikaans, but we are saying is allow our children to enter a school and learn in a language that is preferable. A language that is used in a country. That is our argument”. The South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) said in a statement on Thursday that it condemned racism at the school, saying the protests at the school were justified. According to Sadtu, it will mount a campaign, together with progressive structures, to transform the school. eNCA
