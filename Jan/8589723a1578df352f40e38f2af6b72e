JOHANNESBURG – Scores of people have since Monday taken to social media to pay tribute to legendary jazz musician Hugh Masekela. But equally, South African Twitter was on its toes, ready to strike at any moment. Cupcake takes leadership once again. This challenge stops here!!! #markfishchallange #cnn #leadership pic.twitter.com/UuDTfI9SRl When former football star Mark Fish added his voice to thank Masekela on the network, users were left stunned. Like everyone else, Fish was paying tribute to the renowned jazz musician, except he used a picture of musician Sipho "Hotstix" Mabuse, instead of Masekela.
