CAPE TOWN - Cape Townâ€™s famous minstrels are competing for bragging rights as the best troupe in the city. Thousands lined the streets to watch the musicians and dancers parade through the city. It's a tradition that's over a hundred years old. The troupes will now fight it out every Saturday for the rest of January. Judges will decide the winner based on the best dance moves and music. "What this carnival has become is a carnival where people come together, we re-unite. We celebrate our tradition and of course it has become one of these big brass band extravaganza. With people who are taught music without being formally educated in music," says Muneeb Gambeno, Kaapse Klopse Karnival Association. eNCA
