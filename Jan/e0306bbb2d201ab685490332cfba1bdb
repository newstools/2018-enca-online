PRETORIA – The University of South Africa (Unisa) has announced that will re-open applications for the 2018 academic year for first-time entering undergraduate students who have not previously applied for admission to the 2018 academic year. The university has directed first-time entering undergraduate students to apply via the university’s website or a self-help station at Unisa's Service Centres by Friday.

Unisa said the decisions were made following communication from Universities South Africa last week regarding how universities should manage walk-in students during the 2018 registration period. The university also informed that it will open undergraduate applications for the second in April.
