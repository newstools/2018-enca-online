EKURHULENI – Two of South Africa’s top amateur talents, Kyle McClatchie and Garrick Higgo, laid down an early marker in the opening round of the BMW SA Open at Glendower Golf Club. Not a bad way to start the @BMWSAOpen!

World number 129 McClatchie turned one under, but he fired up the home crowd when he racked up five birdies in the first six holes of his homeward loop. The reigning English Mens Stroke Play champion was upbeat after a solid start in the national championship despite errant tee shots on 16 and 18 that resulted in bogeys. “To be just three shots off the pace is icing on the cake,” said the 20-year-old Serengeti golfer. “It was a much effort than last year. I bagged important birdies at 15 and 16 after a soft bogey at the second and I made a great up-and-down from the bunker at 17 that kept the round going. Since that 1st tee shot:
		-- 4
		-- 8
		-- 1

		T4 in #BMWSAOpen @City_Ekurhuleni @GlendowerGC pic.twitter.com/8XsXA1tmSi “I holed a 10-footer for birdie at the first and tapped in for birdie at second to keep the momentum going and made three in a row at four, five and six. The fourth and fifth holes are two of the toughest scoring holes on this course, so I was really glad to come through those with a pair of birdies. “I drove it straight into the trees left at seven. All I could do was punch out. I hit a wedge to 10 feet, but I missed the par putt. I hit a poor drive at eight and short-sided myself with the second, but made a great up-and-down to save par.” McClatchie has always battled at the par-four ninth and today was no different. “I hit my tee shot left in the trees, got it into the fairway with a sideways chip and hit a good wedge to 12 foot, but missed the putt,” he said. “But I wasn’t disheartened. I had a solid round and a bit of good luck cancelled the odd bad lie or poor tee shot. The international experience I gained over the last year in Europe and the United States really helped me to settle on this stage and helped me to take a good attitude out there.” De Zalze GC member, @garrick_higgo gets his maiden @BMWSAOpen tee shot away.

The Stellenbosch golfer – who leads the South African Golf Association’s Open Amateur rankings – campaigned in the United States for four months, where he reached the semifinal of the US Junior Amateur and represented the International Team in the inaugural Junior Presidents Cup.
