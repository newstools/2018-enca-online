JOHANNESBURG – Supersport United has announced the signing of Mogakolodi Ngele from Mamelodi Sundowns on a six-month loan deal. The 27-year-old Botswana international enjoyed a successful three-year spell at Platinum Stars helping them to MTN 8 and Telkom Knock-Out titles and scoring over 25 goals in all competitions. He has since been struggling for game time since joining Sundowns in 2015. Supersport CEO Stan Matthews expressed delight at Ngele’s signing saying that he [Ngele] would be a vital instrument to Matsantsantsa. “Since the departure of Jeremy Brockie to Sundowns, and with Bradley Grobler injured, we need some experience up front to help bring some of our youngsters through, the same way Yeye has helped Teboho Mokoena and Sipho Mbule, our hope is that Mogakolodi can be that player, he has an amazing record, winning trophies wherever he goes and making critical contributions in big games., Mathews said. The Pretoria based side has also announced contract renewals for midfielder Reneilwe Letsholonyane and defender Clayton Daniels. “Yeye and Clayton have shown tremendous commitment to the club and have been heavily involved in our success over the last few years,” Mathews said. eNCA
