JOHANNESBURG – One of Ethiopia’s most prominent opposition politicians has been sentenced to six months in prison for contempt of court along with three others after they sang a protest song during proceedings, AP reported. Bekele Gerba, former deputy head of the Oromo Federalist Congress party, protested after the court withdrew a previous ruling requiring Ethiopia’s prime minister to appear as a defence witness. The state-affiliated Fana Broadcasting Corporate says Bekele and the other defendants “wreaked havoc.” READ: Ethiopia bans foreign adoption Gerba was charged with terrorism and other offences after he was arrested in December 2015 during anti-government protests that raged across parts of Ethiopia.
