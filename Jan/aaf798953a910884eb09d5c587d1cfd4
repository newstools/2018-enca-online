JOHANNESBURG - Suspended Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille says the DA Cape Metro executive does not have the support of branch and caucus members for its call for her to be removed. The metro executive said on Wednesday it had recommended to the party's national, provincial and city leaders that she be removed. The executive's chairman, Grant Twigg, said it had lost confidence in De Lille, especially after she had gone against decisions of the Cape Town caucus.Â  But De Lille said she had received "numerous calls" from branch members saying that they have never been consulted on this statement by the regional executive and that they had not given them the mandate. The metro executive needed to provide proof that it had consulted members of branches and of the Cape Town caucus, she said. WATCH: 'I'm going to sue the hell out of those who claim I stole': De Lille "This is yet another example of the flagrant disregard for process within the DA in their rush to get rid of me and make Minister Bonginkosi Madikizela the next executive mayor. "It illustrates my previous position that these attacks on me have been about power and positions all along," De Lille said in a statement. De Lille has been accused of covering up alleged multimillion-rand fraud in the city's Foreshore Freeway Precinct tender and of mismanagement. She denies any wrongdoing and has promised to fight her accusers in court. In September, the party put her on special leave, and an inquiry was established to examine the political management of Cape Town. Twigg told eNCA De Lille had gone against her caucus's recommendation that the Bowman report be adopted. The report, by law form Bowman Gilfillan, said the mayor could be guilty of misconduct and should be further investigated. The DA federal executive, having suspended De Lille, met on Sunday to consider her fate. It said it would announce its decision this coming weekend. eNCA
