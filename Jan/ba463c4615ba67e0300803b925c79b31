JOHANNESBURG – A satellite police station in Munsieville, Krugersdorp was set alight and three police vehicles stoned during a violent protest in Gauteng’s West Rand on Monday. Another police station was attacked in Kagiso. So far, 58 people have been arrested for public violence. Police Portfolio Committee Chairperson Francois Beukman has criticised the violence in the protest. Several houses were set alight in the wake of the violent protest. The men in blue were struggling to contain thousands of residents who torched the homes of foreign nationals, accusing them of drug dealing. #KrugersdorpShutdown https://t.co/Wn7rtYuw2N Beukman says residents have a right to assemble and demonstrate but condemned the act of torching buildings especially police stations. “The satellite police station was intended to serve the very same community. By burning it, the community has exacerbated the challenge of inadequate policing infrastructure in Gauteng,” Beukman added. Police outnumbered eNCA’s Lirandzu Themba, reporting live from the scene, said the town was in turmoil with police and residents engaged in running battles. In Munsieville, outside the West Rand town, police were trying to control a 3,000-strong crowd with water cannons and rubber bullets. Police were outnumbered, which allowed some angry protesters to torch homes and a police station.
