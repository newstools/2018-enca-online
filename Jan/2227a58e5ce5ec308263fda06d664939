CAPE TOWN - The confidential report into Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille, seen by eNCA, paints a picture of a power-hungry bully. The report, compiled for the DA federal executive by chief whip John Steenhuisen, MP Patricia Kopane and others, forms the basis of the misconduct charges against De Lille. WATCH: Patricia de Lille to be formally charged by DA, not suspended The report describes the City of Cape Town council as a toxic environment that threatens to derail the party’s 2019 electoral prospects. Councilors made oral and written submissions describing De Lille as very hardworking and dedicated to the city. But her detractors also used the words "bully", "vindictive", "impatient" and "prone to outbursts" and "humiliating anyone who doesn’t agree with her". Perhaps the main concern is the alleged utterance made by De Lille that it is “Brand Patricia” that is responsible for the city’s success. The perception is that she distances herself from the DA. De Lille has vowed to clear her name, accusing a cabal of powerful men of trying to drag her down. eNCA
