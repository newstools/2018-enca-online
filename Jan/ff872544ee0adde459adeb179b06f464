JOHANNESBURG - From coast to coast, pupils across South Africa headed back to school on Wednesday, and thousands of children went to school for the first time. Desperate parents on the Cape Flats say it’s imperative their children go to school to protect them from daily gang violence. Some parents queued at schools in the hope of getting last-minute placements for their offspring. At Ditawana and Thembalihle primary schools in Orlando East, Soweto It was all smiles for the Grade Rs and Grade 1s. They struck their best pose each time they saw the camera coming towards them.       At King Edward VII Preparatory School in Johannesburg, pupils were calm as they waited to be weaned off their parents into the care of their new teachers. Gone were the days when little ones clutched onto their parents for dear life in Grade 1. There's a lot of pressure on Eastern Cape pupils to perform this year, as the province recorded the poorest matric results in the country last year. The premier wants top-performing schools to share their expertise with their peers. Some schools in the province were struggling with late registrations on Wednesday. The education department said the last batches of textbooks will be delivered to schools before the end of the month. The Department of Education in KwaZulu-Natal says all schools in the province opened without any hiccups on the first day of the 2018 school calendar year. This despite challenges at some schools late last year when about 24 schools were damaged by storms. eNCA
