JOHANNESBURG - As Afropunk Joburg festival-goers were dancing and singing along to DJ Kenzero's beats to celebrate the New Year, Anderson .Paak and the Free Nationals arrived quietly at Constitution Hill the in a shuttle. Anderson sat right at the back of the taxi and smiled at artists and a handful of media who waited to catch a glimpse of him.  Inside the very softly lit and ambient backstage trailer, the multi-talented Anderson .Paak sat calmly in front of a drum kit as he prepared to perform.  The humble artist smiled and spoke very candidly about his recent performance in Cape Town and how much he looked forward to performing at Afropunk. "It feels great to finally perform for an audience that looks like you," he said. eNCA
