JOHANNESBURG - Cape Town's looming Day Zero is no laughing matter, with the date the city is expected to run out of water moved up to April 12. Management of the water crisis has been taken away from embattled mayor Patricia de Lille, and given to a DA-led team. Western Cape premier Helen Zille has been tweeting a number of personal water-saving tips, including using a 'skottel' (dish) to bath in. But, Twitter users were quick to point out that Zille appears to be using the method incorrectly. eNCA
