JOHANNESBURG - Africa has a new internet domain name, .africa. The team responsible for the domain are celebrating the achievement by climbing the highest mountain on the continent, Mount Kilimanjaro, this January. They say demand for the domain is overwhelming. According to domains.co.za, the aim of having a .africa domain name is to bring the internet business community of the entire continent together and assist in developing e-commerce, technology and infrastructure. The Follow the Flag initiative says the mission to create Africa’s very own online identity began as far back as the OR Tambo and Abuja Declarations of the 1990s, where it was resolved to use ICT to ensure the development of Africa. eNCA
