JOHANNESBUR - Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi says his department will appeal Monday's court ruling which found that Hoerskool Overvaal doesn't have the capacity to accommodate 55 English-speaking pupils. "This has been a long long struggle so we will attend to those issues. I've issued instructions to our officials they must ensure they get the necessary paper work documents even if this matter can go to the Constitutional Court," says Lesufi.

We are not asking for anything we are saying let our children sing, dance and study together. If that is unlawful let someone come and tell us why," he said. Hoërskool Overvaal in Vereeniging and the Gauteng education department have been embroiled in a court battle, with the school insisting it cannot admit the pupils because it lacks capacity and resources. The school argued that the department cannot simply give it instructions and enforce something which is against the school’s policy. eNCA
