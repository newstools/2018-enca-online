JOHANNESBURG – A video of a Kempton Park resident being hijacked and shot in front of his home has surfaced. The victim, according to Kempton Express, was taken to hospital by a neighbour after he managed to run away from the scene, “seemingly clutching his wound with his left hand and waving his right hand in the air.” In the 50 second-long video, two men are seen walking slowly towards the victim’s car before they start their mission. eNCA
