LONDON - Highly-regarded French defender Aymeric Laporte could become runaway Premier League leaders Manchester City's record signing according to British media reports on Thursday. The 23-year-old centre-back -- who has been at Athletic Bilbao since he was 16 -- would cost City £57million (R964-million) owing to a release clause in his contract at Bilbao but would resolve a problematic area for manager Pep Guardiola  where veteran Vincent Kompany is injury-prone and Frenchman Eliaquim Mangala has not impressed.

According to The Sun and the BBC, Guardiola favours investing that amount in Laporte -- who has yet to win a senior France cap though he was called up for two 2018 World Cup qualifiers -- than spending around £24million on rivals West Bromwich Albion's 30-year-old Northern Irish central defender Jonny Evans.
