JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma has filed an appeal to the court ruling that he is too conflicted to appoint the head of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). The North Gauteng High Court ruled last month that Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa should make the appointment within 60 days (by about 20 January). At the same time, the court ruled the appointment of prosecutions head Shaun Abrahams was invalid. Zuma's appeal argues that the court erred in allowing for two presidents in the country. It said Zuma could not appoint a new prosecutions boss because there is a conflict in that the NPA is deciding whether to bring back charges of fraud and corruption against him. The NPA and Abrahams have indicated they, too, will appeal the ruling.
