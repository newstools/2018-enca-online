JOHANNESBURG - Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe has confirmed to eNCA that former finance chief Anoj Singh lied to Parliament. Singh on Tuesday told an inquiry he didn't mislead anyone about the power utility’s relationship with Trillian. WATCH: Singh testifies at Eskom inquiry But Phasiwe says that's not true. “Yesterday he told parliamentarians that he was not aware that there was a statement that there’s a statement I had issued to the media saying that Eskom does not have any dealings with Trillian. All I was contesting was that that particular statement that we had issued had been approved by Mr Singh and the other executives including the CEO. The information that I always give to the media is from the executives and in some cases from the board as well,” says Phasiwe. eNCA
