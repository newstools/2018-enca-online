JOHANNESBURG – Gauteng police say they are on alert and monitoring the situation across malls after EFF supporters stormed into several H&M stores across the province on Saturday morning. The protest seems to have moved countrywide with reports in the Western Cape. Protesters gathered at The Mall of the South, Sandton City, Mall of Africa, and Menlyn Mall. A scuffle broke out in Sandton, as security guards tried blocking demonstrators from entering the store. Protesters destroyed clothes in Menlyn. They accuse H&M of racism after the retailer used a black child to model a sweatshirt with the slogan "coolest monkey in the jungle". The advert has since removed the online advert.
