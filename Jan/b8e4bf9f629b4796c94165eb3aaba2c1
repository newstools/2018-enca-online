JOHANNESBURG - EFF national chairperson, Dali Mpofu described H&M's apology over a 'racist advert' as a hollow one. The clothing retail giant has received flack over its use of a black child wearing a hoody with the writing ‘Coolest Monkey in the Jungle’, in an advert. Party members have been protesting outside various H&M stores since Saturday. "What they’ve said is true but that doesn’t make it acceptable. It is actually unacceptable. We were simply expressing how unacceptable it is to us. One of the plagues is the undying scourge of racism, people experience it on a daily basis and it's something we cannot tolerate," said Mpofu. "We cannot accept that apology, it must go much further than that. We are taking steps to check if they are able to operate in this country if this is the kind of contribution they are going to be making," he said. eNCA
