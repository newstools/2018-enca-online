PARIS - Hollywood stars Rupert Everett and John Turturro are to star in the first television adaptation of The Name of the Rose, its producers said Wednesday. The big-budget eight-part series drawn from the late Umberto Eco's classic murder mystery set in the Middle Ages, will be screened next year, said Orange Content, the production end of the French telecommunication giant. American Tuturro -- best known for The Big Lebowski -- will play the Franciscan monk William of Baskerville who witnesses a series of macabre murders at a remote monastery in the Italian Alps.
