They've also burnt tires and rubbish. A parent was assaulted by protesters picketing outside the Afrikaans-medium school. The protesters say the court judgment is unfair and perpetuates segregation. Last week, the high court ruled that the school doesn't have the capacity to accommodate 55 English-speaking pupils. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said his department will appeal Monday's court ruling.

The EFF's Mohale Maseko said the school should see it as a positive sign that parents have confidence in it and the teaching system. “Why should they deprive learner who wants to learn in a different language?" he asked. eNCA
