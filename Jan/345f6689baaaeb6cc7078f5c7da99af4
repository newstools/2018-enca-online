JOHANNESBURG - The Gauteng education department says it's ready to face off with an Afrikaans medium school in court. Hoërskool Overvaal's governing body wants the court to overturn the department's decision, ordering it to accept 55 English-speaking pupils. The school refused because it only caters for Afrikaans-speaking pupils.

"We have 31,000 pupils to place, so as a department we've been identifying schools we believe can absorb learners." The case has been postponed to allow parties to study relevant documentation.  eNCA
