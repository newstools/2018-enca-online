"The appointment of an experienced, qualified and credible leadership to the Board of Eskom, as well as the injunction to immediately remove all executives implicated in corruption and other acts of impropriety at Eskom is in line with the key priorities of the African National Congress drawn from the 54th National Conference and the 8 January statement to restore the credibility of public institutions, state-owned enterprises and law enforcement agencies. It is also practical action responding to our commitment to confront corruption and state capture in all its forms." "The African National Congress wishes the newly appointed Board of Directors as well as Acting CEO Mr Phakamani Hadebe well in their quest to return Eskom to its rightful place as a high-performance organisation with an ethical leadership at the helm. We further assure them of our unwavering support in their mission to serve the public in line with their development mandate."
