READ: Court orders Brian Molefe to 'pay back the money' The court unanimously found that Molefe resigned, his declaration that he did not resign was not true and that he was never entitled to pension money. In court papers, Molefe says the court made a mistake when it set aside an Eskom board decision to accept his early retirement. The money he had already received with regards to pension must be paid back in 10 days, and the claim of early retirement that he publicly made was false and deceitful. The amount was paid out to Molefe in late 2016 when he left the power utility after Madonsela implicated him in suspicious dealings between Eskom and the politically-connected Gupta family. eNCA
