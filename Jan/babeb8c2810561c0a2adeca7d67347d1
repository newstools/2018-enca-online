They burned them, threw their bodies into the grave, put the woman’s coffin on top of them, and they put soil [in the grave] before they dispersed,” Ngoepe said. “The police were summoned and reacted swiftly; all three bodies, including the one for the woman, were then exhumed for further police investigations. The motive behind this incident is still unknown, but the police investigations will tell as they are still unfolding,” Ngoepe said. Limpopo police commissioner Lt-Gen Nneke Ledwaba condemned the incident “with dismay at the fact that some of the community members are still ignoring our continuous earnest call for them to stop these barbaric acts of mob-related attacks”.
