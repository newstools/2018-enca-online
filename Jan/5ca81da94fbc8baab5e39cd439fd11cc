LOS ANGELES - Reality television star Kim Kardashian West has been accused of cultural appropriation after she flaunted her new grey braids hairstyle on her social media accounts. Kim K (37) called her new hairdo the 'Bo Derek braids' which she said were inspired by the American actress Bo Derek when she had a similar hairstyle in 1979. Kardashian, who's just become a mother for the third time through surrogacy, had been posting semi-nude pictures of herself. Singer Lindsay Lohan commented on her post, saying she was confused, which Kardashian West met with a knee-jerk response accusing Lohan of having a fake foreign accent. eNCA
