JOHANNESBURG – Congress of the People (Cope) Member of Parliament (MP) Deidre Carter wants the law changed to force marriage officers to officiate same sex unions. Carter lodged a private member bill, aimed at repealing a section of the Civil Union Act. The act allows a marriage officer employed by the state to be exempted from presiding over same sex marriages, for religious reasons, or on the basis of conscience or belief.

That is because all marriage officers at a Home Affairs branch had been exempted from officiating. Same sex unions were legalised in 2006 but Carter claims the law is unconstitutional, because it discriminates unfairly. eNCA
