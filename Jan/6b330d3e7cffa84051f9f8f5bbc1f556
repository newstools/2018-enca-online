CAPE TOWN - Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille is fighting back. In a 200-page document obtained exclusively by eNCA, De Lille says the allegations made by the so-called Steenhuisen Report contain anonymous allegations and she is the victim of a witch hunt. The document cuts through the allegations against her with the prowess of a surgical knife. But despite her thorough defence, the DA’s Federal Executive has charged her with misconduct. READ: Turbulent times for the DA In the leaked document, De Lille says the claims calling her a power-hungry megalomaniac, prone to outbursts, and humiliating those who disagree with her, were made by nameless councillors. She says the Steenhuisen report is nothing but a witch hunt in which her rights were grossly violated and it’s clear, she says, the DA wants to get rid of her.

She is also going to fight her suspension on the basis it’s procedurally flawed. eNCA
