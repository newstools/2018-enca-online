JOHANNESBURG South African household finances were in a healthier state in the third quarter of 2017, compared with the same period the previous year. Momentum’s latest household wealth Index shows that real net household wealth grew by an estimated 2.5 percent. A household's net wealth is the difference between its assets and liabilities. Over the past three years the financial wealth of South African households had deteriorated steadily, with higher taxes and prices eroding household income. The wealth Index shows that real value of household net wealth was R175-billion higher in the third quarter of 2017. Momentum researcher and economist Johann van Tonder attributed the improvement to an increase in the JSE all-share index.

That means households will become a lot more confident during 2018 to start spending and saving and investing. Which is good news for the South African economy," he said
	
	Momentum says that in contrast to the strong performance in the real value of household assets during the third quarter, the real value of liabilities increased at a subdued rate. Van Tonder said there was a long way to go before South Africa could consider itself financially well. "We need to get more households into employment. It’s only when they are in the job market that they can earn a sustainable income in order to start building wealth. Then they can access mortgages in order to purchase property. It’s then when they can start saving for a retirement, for education, emergencies, unplanned expenses."
