JOHANNESBURG - Retail group Massmart said on Thursday that total sales last year increased by 2.7 percent to R93.7-billion, compared with 2016. Massmart, which owns such brands as Game, Makro, Builder’s Warehouse and CBW, said total sales rose by a lesser 1 percent to R92.1 billion when making an exact 52-week comparison between 2017 and 2016. The company's 2017 financial year was a 53-week trading period, which ended on 31 December 2017, which complicated useful comparisons with the previous year’s 52-week period that ended on 25 December 2016.
