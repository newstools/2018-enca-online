Obviously, you don't want to see a player in the crowd "There's no way he's going in the crowd -- because I know him, he's a great lad -- unless he was provoked severely. That's all I know. "I haven't had a chance to talk to Jake. I'll speak to Jake and we'll go from there. '' West Ham manager David Moyes claimed he did not see the incident, but added: "I've been told something happened." AFP
