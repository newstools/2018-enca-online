JOHANNESBURG - Hundreds of prospective students pitched up for registration at the University of Johannesburg (UJ) on Monday, despite prevailing heatwave conditions and calls for no walk-in applications. But many in the line claim the online is slow and crashes at times. Students who braved the heat are among the 115,000 online applicants hoping to secure one of the 10,500 first-year spots available at the university. They say they have no choice but to come to the university.
