JOHANNESBURG - The EFF is protesting outside H&M store in Mall of Africa. H&M has been underfire over its online advert that depicted a black child wearing a hoodie with "Coolest Monkey in the Jungle" written on the front. Over the weekend members of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) raided the store, along with other of their shops nationwide, knocking over merchandise and mannequins in an anti-racism protest. H&M has since apologised for its post. eNCA
