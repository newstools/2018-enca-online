JOHANNESBURG - The family of slain anti-apartheid activist, Ahmed Timol, want the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to take action on the findings of an inquest. In October Judge Billy Mothle recommended that three former security police members face charges, Joao Rodrigues, 80, as an accessory to murder and Seth Sona and Neville Els, both aged 82, for perjury. It was found that apartheid police killed him in October 1971. WATCH: Ahmed Timol was murdered, judge rules He was assaulted, tortured and thrown out of a window on the 10th floor of John Vorster Square police station in Johannesburg. The original police inquest had claimed he committed suicide. The family say they aren't seeking vengeance against the men - all they want is for them to admit the truth. eNCA
