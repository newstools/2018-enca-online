JOHANNESBURG - The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) and its head Shaun Abrahams are appealing last month's court decision setting aside Abrahams' appointment as NPA boss. They say the North Gauteng High Court erred in finding that President Jacob Zuma appointed Abrahams because he was less likely to charge the president than his predecessor, Mxolisi Nxasana. In an affidavit filed to the Constitutional Court, the NPA says while the R17-million "golden handshake" given to former NPA head Mxolisi Nxasana was invalid, Abrahams' appointment was valid. This is the order that #ShaunAbrahams and NPA want @ConCourtSA to grant:

The court ruled that Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa should appoint a new NPA head within 60 days. Zuma has also appealed the ruling, arguing that the deputy president could only execute the president's functions if he was out of the country or impeached. eNCA
