JOHANNESBURG – The Automobile Association (AA) has come out guns blazing against the off-bridge rock-throwing scourge happening in parts of Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal. Incidents of rock throwing, with the intention of forcing drivers to stop, has led to either the robbing or hijacking motorists. Two people died as a result of rock throwing in KwaZulu-Natal alone, with another man seriously injured when a rock was thrown at his car at about 10pm on the N2 northbound in Tongaat near Durban.

While the association laments the lack of a permanent, “perfect solution” to dealing with the problem, it has since released a list of tips that could be useful to motorists: • If possible, avoid driving on roads known for rock throwing
	• Be alert to movement on a bridge before you go under it
	• As far as possible, drive during daylight hours to make seeing the environment around you easier
	• If there are passengers in the vehicle with you, ask them to check for any movement on the bridge
	• If you are the victim of a thrown rock, try and remain as calm as you possible can while assessing the situation around you
	• Pull off to the side of the road, only once it is safe to do so, to check on damage
	• Contact police and emergency services immediately The AA further cautioned motorists to avoid changing lanes before entering under a bridge. “This may work if there is no other traffic around and you are able to move freely between lanes.” ”However, this is problematic if there are other cars who are in the same area. Stick to the speed limits, always obey the rules of the road and always be vigilant of what other drivers [and people] are doing,” the AA suggested. eNCA
