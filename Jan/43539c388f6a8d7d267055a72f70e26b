JOHANNESBURG – The Democratic Alliance (DA) is demanding President Jacob Zuma to release the Terms of Reference (ToR) for the Judicial Commission of inquiry into state capture. The party on Thursday wrote a letter to Zuma demanding for the release of the ToR. It says the establishment of the Judicial Commission is beyond overdue. “If the President had respected the Constitutional mandate of the Public Protector, the report on the findings of the Judicial Inquiry should have been finalised by June last year, a full seven months ago,” the party said in a statement.
