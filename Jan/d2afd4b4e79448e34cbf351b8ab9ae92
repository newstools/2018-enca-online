KWAZULU - NATAL - The ANC's outgoing KwaZulu-Natal executive committee has welcomed the national body's decision to suspend the KZN provincial leadership. In 2017, the High Court ruled the 2015 conference that elected Sihle Zikalala as chairperson was illegitimate. The ANC's NEC on Friday night announced it's suspended the KZN and Free State provincial leaderships.

Interim structures will now take over both provinces in a bid to build unity. The outgoing KZN PEC says it fully accepts the decision, and looks forward to working as ordinary members. “We welcome this decision. We are very excited about it. The suspension of the PEC gives all of us an opportunity to join the ordinary ranks and file of members of the African National Congress and work with the incoming provincial task team, the interim leadership to prepare for the conference which we believe is going to take place within the next three months,” says Mdumiseni Ntuli, Outgoing ANC KZN Spokesperson. The NEC’s decision is likely to be seen as a victory for the so-called ANC rebels in the province. That faction took Sihle Zikalala’s PEC to court over the legitimacy of the 2015 provincial conference, and won. eNCA
