KWAZULU-NATAL - African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General Ace Magashule has urged members to support President Jacob Zuma, since the party has not decided to remove him. He says the narrative that Zuma must be removed before his term ends is from those who want the party to fail. Magashule was speaking during the ANC Youth League's January eight event in KwaZulu-Natal. “There’s no decision which we have taken as the NEC that he [Zuma] must go - we have not taken such a decision. It’s only factional leaders who want to be populist, the ones who are loved by the papers, the ones who don’t know the ANC, who are making noise outside. We, as disciplined members, engage our issues within the ANC, not in the papers," he said. His comments stand in stark contrast to those of ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa, who on Thursday said Zuma was anxious about his future. He made the comments in an interview with CNN in Davos, Switzerland, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum.

He further said the ANC would keep the best interests of South Africa in mind in dealing with Zuma's exit and not the interest of an individual. On Sunday, Magashule cames out guns blazing against those seeking to implicate him in the contentious Vrede diary farm that was raided by the Hawks on Friday.
