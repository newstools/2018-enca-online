That ruled Lukaku out of Monday's trip to his former club Everton and he is set to be absent for the FA Cup third round tie with Derby on Friday. Speaking prior to the Everton match, Mourinho told Sky Sports: "I would say a week (out for Lukaku). "It's nothing really important - just a little protection, but no problem." United's next Premier League game, at home to Stoke, isn't for 10 days after the Derby game, giving Lukaku time to return for that fixture.
