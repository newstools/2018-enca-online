City, 12 points clear at the summit of English football, are bidding to bring the Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup and Champions League titles to the Etihad.

Bernardo Silva appeared to have doubled the visitors' lead with a thunderous 26th-minute shot but his goal was ruled out because the officials deemed Leroy Sane to be off-side and interfering with play.

But the second goal that Pep Guardiola's men had threatened arrived in the 37th minute when Silva's superb curling cross from the left was glanced in by Raheem Sterling. If you're going to send your side through to the FA Cup fifth round, do it in style.
