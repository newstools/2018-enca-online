The province came in third in the country with a pass rate of 82.8 percent.  Western Cape Education MEC Debbie Schäfer said the province had also performed well in other key measurements. In a statement, Schäfer said that while there is a tendency to focus solely on the provincial pass rate -- which is an important indicator -- other important indicators of success also needed to be taken into consideration to determine if the system is ultimately improving or where it needs to be improved. Schäfer added that more learners in the Western Cape are taking maths and science as a percentage of the cohort, “something that we have been encouraging over a number of years”. She further lauded the top performing learners from the province, including Janke Van Dyk from Bellville High School who was the top achiever in the country, and Matthys Carstens from Durbanville High School who was placed second. All eight education districts in the Western Cape achieved over 80 percent pass rate and Schäfer singled out the Overberg district that achieved 10th place in the country out of 70 districts with a pass rate of 87.7 percent. - Additional reporting ANA  !function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+"://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,"script","twitter-wjs"); eNCA
