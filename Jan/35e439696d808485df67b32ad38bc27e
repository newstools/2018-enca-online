CAPE TOWN - Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown acknowledges that Eskom is in crisis, but does not believe she is solely responsible for the status quo. “I am saying that Eskom is actually in a very difficult financial position - it is in a crisis position. Over the weekend a new board had been appointed to withstand the crisis and I would like to give that board an opportunity now to put in place plans for recoveries to take place,” the minister said.
