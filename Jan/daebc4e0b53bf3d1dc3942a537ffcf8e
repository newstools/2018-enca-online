LONDON - Britain's unemployment rate remains at the lowest level in more than 40 years, according to official data Wednesday that showed wages growth still lagging inflation. The jobless rate -- or the proportion of the workforce that is unemployed -- stood at 4.3 percent in the three months to the end of November, the Office for National Statistics said in a statement. This was helped by a stronger-than-expected rise in employment to 32.2 million people -- the highest level since records began in 1971, the ONS added. Unemployment fell 3,000 to 1.44 million people.

"The 102,000 rise in employment in the three months to November was far stronger" than market forecasts. Average weekly earnings meanwhile grew 2.5 percent in the year to November, but still lower than overall UK inflation. "With the employment rate returning to a joint record-high and the number of vacancies setting a new record, demand for workers clearly remains strong," said ONS statistician David Freeman. "Nevertheless, inflation remains higher than pay growth and so the real value of earnings continues to decline."

Consequently, the Bank of England raised its main interest rate in November for the first time in a decade -- to 0.5 percent from a record-low 0.25 percent. The pound, however, is in recovery mode, in part on rising expectations of further rate tightening from the BoE in 2018. AFP
