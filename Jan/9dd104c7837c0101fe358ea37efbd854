JOHANNESBURG - Meghan Markle is planning to break with royal tradition and give a speech at her wedding reception, the Daily Mail reported on Monday. The self-avowed feminist, who is expected to be given the title of Duchess on her big day, is reportedly planning an "affectionate" tribute to her new husband Prince Harry. Although her father Thomas (73) is expected to walk her down the aisle, the former Hollywood lighting director is very private and unlikely to speak at the wedding breakfast.

Harry thinks it’s a great idea." Prince Harry (33) and Markle (36) will marry in front of 800 guests at St George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle, on May 19. African News Agency
