JOHANNESBURG - The JSE opened flat in thin trade on Monday‚ as gold shares rallied on a weaker dollar and general retailers retreated on weakness in Woolworths and Steinhoff. Woolworths said in a trading update that group sales for the first 26 weeks of the 2018 financial year to December 24 increased 2.5 percent over the prior period and 2.9 percent in constant currency terms. It expects earnings to drop up to 20 percent for the interim period. Steinhoff lost ground amid indications that it might face further class-action suits from disgruntled investors. The share price has dropped 91 percent since December. The gold price was up 0.32 percent to $1‚341.52 an ounce‚ near a four-month high. READ: Interest rate unlikely to change: economists The gold price has been benefiting from a weaker dollar on expectations that the European Central Bank (ECB) would reduce its easing policies at a quicker pace. This would lead to eventual interest-rate increases amid upbeat economic growth in the Eurozone‚ at a time when the US Federal Reserve might take a more measured approach in its own normalisation process. “We have revised our higher our outlook for euro area growth in 2018 and look for a reformulation of forward guidance by the ECB on interest rate policy in April‚” analysts at Barclays Research said. READ: Interest rate unlikely to change: economists The gold price rose 13.11 percent in 2017 is up 2.67 percent 2018. At the same time‚ the Dow has gained 4.39 percent in 2018 and rose 25.08 percent in 2017. TreasuryOne analyst Gerard van der Westhuizen said the rally in gold was set to continue as the metal had crossed $1‚340 an ounce. “Gold is generally seen as a safe haven and with global equity prices continuing to increase‚ the rise in prices in both asset classes was quite unique‚” he said. iNet Bridge
