JOHANNESBURG - South African bonds were slightly weaker shortly before noon on Monday‚ with the domestic focus squarely on the unfolding political situation within the ANC. Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to deliver his first January 8 statement on Saturday‚ with speculation last week that President Jacob Zuma had been given until Tuesday to resign. This provided some short-term support for the rand‚ with net foreign purchases of SA bonds and equities of about R5-billion having followed in the week after Ramaphosa was elected president.

At 11.30 the R186 was bid at 8.59 percent from 8.54 percent and the R207 was at 7.24 percent from 7.21 percent. The rand was at R12.4136 from R12.3303. iNet Bridge
