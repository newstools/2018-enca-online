WEENEN, KwaZulu-Natal – The provincial government is stable despite instability in the African National Congress (ANC), KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Premier Willies Mchunu said on Friday. The ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) suspended the provincial leadership, appointing an interim structure to overlook political affairs in KZN. Mchunu says the legitimacy of his government is not in doubt. WATCH: Timeframe set for ANC KZN provincial conference “What the NEC did not do is to tamper with government. Therefore, there is nothing that was said about the government and there has never been a complaint from any member of the ANC about the structure of government. There is also no complaint from society about the structure of [the provincial] government.” Critics accuse the premier of being missing in action, a claim he denies. “I don’t know where I have been missing in action. I’ve been part and parcel, I’ve convened the first executive council of the province and I’ve attended even national lekgotlas of the ANC in preparation for the provincial lekgotla,” he said. ANC secretary general Ace Magashule says party squabbles are impacting service delivery. Mchunu denies this, saying it is business as usual in KZN. “Up to today, nobody has had a rest among the MECs. We wouldn’t have been intervening in areas where there has been instability in the province and we are continuing to function as usual... They shouldn’t even have the slightest doubt that government is functioning,” Mchunu maintains. The ANC in KZN has until the end of April to rerun its 2015 elective conference. eNCA
