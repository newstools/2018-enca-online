CAPE TOWN - Members of Parliament (MPs) on Tuesday questioned the competency of former Eskom chief executive officer (CEO) Anoj Singh. The embattled former executive, who is believed to have been involved in tender irregularities linked to Gupta-owned companies at a number of state-owned enterprises, took the stand at the Eskom inquiry in Cape Town. He was also questioned about whether he was telling the National Assembly the truth. Singh handed in his resignation via lawyers late on Monday night.

Inquiry evidence leader Ntuthuzelo Vanara took Singh to task for not keeping a record of an important coal supply meeting between Eskom and Tegeta. Singh's competency was questioned in the exchange. Vanara told him to stop giving contradictory statements. "Mr Singh, I think you need to take this committee very seriously. You can't take the committee as casually as you appear to be,” Vanara said. “First go and check what the policy says before you give an answer. Those are two contradictory, mutually exclusive responses. You need to decide what the answer is." Singh struggled to explain his trip to Dubai. Vanara produced emails showing it was paid for by Gupta-owned Sahara Computers. Finance Minister Malusi Giagaba has welcomed Singh's resignation, which he tendered on Monday.
