JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma has made a last ditch effort to save himself from prosecution. He's filed papers, explaining why he shouldn’t face fraud and corruption charges. National Prosecuting Authority boss Shaun Abrahams was at the NPA’s head office to receive the representations. The original deadline was the 30th of November, but president Zuma received a seven-week extension. Abrahams has given prosecutors two weeks to consider the representations. He'll then decide whether the president will be charged. In October, the Supreme Court of Appeal ruled the 2009 decision to drop charges against the president was unlawful. eNCA
