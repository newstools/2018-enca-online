CAPE TOWN – The first quarter of parliament this is set to be an action-packed period. Parliament will formally open on February 8 during a joint sitting of the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) when President Jacob Zuma delivers the annual State of the Nation Address (Sona). The State of the Nation Address will be debated on 13-14 February, followed by the reply of the president the next day. Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba is expected to present the budget speech on 21 February 2018. Beside Sona and the budget speech, other key parliamentary activities taking place during this quarter are the National Council of Provinces' midterm review, rules review on the impeachment of a president, and the investigation into Steinhoff's corporate corruption. Some Parliamentary Committees have already reported for duty for 2018. They include Parliament's rules committee, which met last week Wednesday to set out presidential impeachment rules, as instructed by the Constitutional Court. “The committee is expected to finalise these provisions and submit them for the approval of the Rules Committee of the National Assembly before the end of February,” parliament said. In December Steinhoff share prices plummeted over 60 percent following the resignation of CEO Markus Jooste amid a probe into alleged accounting irregularities. The retail company has been summoned to parliament at the end of the month. A joint seating of the Standing Committee on Finance, the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, and the Portfolio Committee on Public Service and Administration is scheduled for 30-31 January to deal with the Steinhoff scandal. The portfolio committee on public enterprises will resume with its inquiry into Eskom. eNCA
