JOHANNESBURG - It may seem like an uphill task to complete but SA Under-20 Women’s coach, Maud Khumalo remains optimistic about her side’s chances against their more fancied opponents, hosts Nigeria in their second-leg FIFA Under-20 Women’s World Cup qualifier on Saturday. Ever since I saw you on TV @PearlThusi #Basetsana pic.twitter.com/U5yTHueS4y Basetsana have a tough task of reversing a 2-0 defeat suffered at the hands of the West Africans a fortnight ago in the first leg in Polokwane. Even though Basetsana were in a similar position in their world cup qualifying campaign against Burundi, Khumalo will need to come up with a solid game plan that will dismantle the stubborn Nigerian defence, something the coach believes is possible against Nigeria. Khumalo determined to fight till the end.

We will fight until the referee’s final whistle but most importantly, regardless of the result, this has been a worthwhile experience for these girls,” said Khumalo. -- Watch: Falconets' two goals Vs South Africa's Basetsana at Peter Mokaba stadium in Polokwane. #FIFAU20WWCQ #RSANGA #SoarFalconets pic.twitter.com/Qc2JpSgxne Basetsana are currently in camp at the Safa technical centre in Johannesburg and will have their final training session on Wednesday before departing for Nigeria.
