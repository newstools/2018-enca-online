JOHANNESBURG - On Tuesday news broke that Hugh Masekela lost his battle with prostate cancer, celebrities started sharing their pictures with the jazz musician to pay tribute. Former soccer legend Mark Fish also followed suit and posted a picture on his Twitter page, thanking 'Bra Hugh' for his contribution to his life. The only problem was that he instead posted a picture of himself with another musical legend Sipho 'Hotstix' Mabuse. Mabuse later responded to him saying that he was still very much alive, Fish later removed the picture and apologised for the error. Twitter was unforgiving, he has since been 'dragged', there has been a #MarkFishChallenge started, where users are posting a picture and purposefully getting the subject's names wrong. eNCA
