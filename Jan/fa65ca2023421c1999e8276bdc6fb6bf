JOHANNESBURG - The United Democratic Movement (UDM) and the Congress of the People (Cope) filed a security for costs application on Wednesday against President Jacob Zuma if he appeals the state capture ruling. READ: Zuma files appeal in NPA appointment saga Under the terms of the application, Zuma will have to pay R1-million if he appeals the ruling. eNCA reporter Karyn Maughan explains that the opposition parties accuse the president of using the services of the state attorney unlawfully to prosecute his appeals. "In others words, this is the state vehicle that is being used to protect the president personally [against a] cost order. And the application for leave to appeal is an extension of the reckless conduct identified in that state judgment. Remember the court did not pussyfoot around the issue of president Zuma's kind of pathology of litigation. And even in the Nxasana matter they said he continues to defend the indefensible and [would not] admit that he has been defending the indefensible, all the while funded by the taxpayer. "The applicants in this matter, Cope and the UDM, are saying [we want] R1-million rand from you as a guarantee otherwise we are not prepared to proceed with this litigation. This is the president of this country and it is quite extraordinary," she said. eNCA
