JOHANNESBURG - 143 patients died after being moved from Life Esidimeni to unlicensed NGOs. During the transfer of patients, relations broke down between the Gauteng’s top health official and families.  Officials who have testified at the arbitration have all pointed fingers at Former Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu as the person who pushed for the transfer of patients, despite the dire consequences. #LifeEsidimeni Mahlangu answers a question about what happened to state funds.
