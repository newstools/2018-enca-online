JOHANNESBURG – President Jacob Zuma’s future as president of the country will not be discussed at the ANC national executive committee (NEC) meeting on Thursday, according to ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule. There has been media speculation that the governing party will discuss whether to remove Zuma from the Union Buildings after he was succeeded by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa as party president at the ANC’s 54th national conference in December 2017.

Remember we said that there is interaction between President Zuma and [ANC] president Ramaphosa and that interaction will be continuing,” Magashule said. Last week, Zuma announced a commission of inquiry into allegations of state capture. However, the terms of reference for the inquiry have not been made public. Speaking at a pre-World Economic Forum breakfast in Sandton on Thursday morning, Ramaphosa welcomed the National Prosecuting Authority's move against companies implicated in state capture and said he looked forward to the finalisation of the inquiry's terms of reference. Magashule said the ANC NEC would not be looking to set the terms of reference as this was the government’s role. “There is a president, there is government and you remember that President Zuma is in government and Cyril Ramaphosa is deputy president so it is a matter of government and it is not a matter of the party, the ANC," he said.
