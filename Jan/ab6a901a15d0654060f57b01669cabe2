JOHANNESBURG - The World Health Organisation (WHO) plans to list gaming addiction as a mental health condition. The global health body says persistent gaming can take precedence over and affect other life interests. Some countries already identify a pre-occupation with gaming as a major public health issue. The United Kingdom already has private addiction clinics to treat the disorder. In South Korea, the government placed a ban, bwtween midnight and 6am, on access for online gaming to children under the age of 16. eNCA
