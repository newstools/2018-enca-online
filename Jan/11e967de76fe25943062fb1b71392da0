JOHANNESBURG - Ongoing protests at Hoërskool Overvaal are violating the rights of children to education, Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga said on Monday. There was a heavy police presence at the Vereeniging school on Monday as protesters gathered for a fourth straight day to protest against the school’s language policy. Motshekga, accompanied by Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi, met with stakeholders on Monday afternoon. Hoërskool Overvaal has seen violent protests since it reopened on Wednesday. The protesters are demonstrating after a court ruled the Afrikaans-medium school did not have the capacity to accept 55 English-speaking pupils. More than 40 people have been arrested for public violence. “There were lots and lots of protests and they were escalating at a level that we felt that they might lead to a loss of life or injury or a loss of property,” Lesufi said.

The minister called on protesters to take their grievances up with the department directly. “There should not be any singing in front of schools. We are appealing to everybody to step off, there is a process that is quite clear. If they are unhappy with the court decision, they must be friends of the court, but they must not bring the battle to the school," she said. Protesters insist they will keep on demonstrating until Friday to shine a light on racism at the school. Private security companies have been brought in to ensure that just over 600 pupils arrive and depart safely, amidst the ongoing unrest. eNCA
