CAPE TOWN - Ajax Cape Town coach Muhsin Ertugral may surprise local fans by giving his latest signing fullback Siyanda Zwane a run against Orlando Pirates in Wednesday evening's Absa Premiership clash in the Mother City. Zwane's move from Sundowns to Ajax was completed on Monday and since then he has started training with his new teammates at Ikamva. “He is a player I’ve always admired,” Ertugral said. “He is a marvellous player to watch, he does everything right and has all the fundamentals of a top player.

Outside gives you space on the inside. This game against Pirates will be a chess game.” Following nine successful years at Golden Arrows where he won the 2009 MTN8 title, Zwane joined Mamelodi Sundowns with whom he has tasted league and CAF Champions League success.
