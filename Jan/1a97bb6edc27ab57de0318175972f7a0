JOHANNESBURG – The case involving Cape Town’s alleged underworld bosses has been postponed because the investigating officer currently testifying is ill. Investigating Officer Charl Kinnear has been giving shocking testimony in what is proving to be one of the city’s biggest organised crime cases. Nafiz Modack, the alleged mastermind behind the city’s nightclub security takeover, has been linked to high-ranking politicians and top cops too. Modack, Colin Booysen, Ashley Fields, Jacques Cronje and Carl Lakay have been charged with intimidation and eight counts of extortion.

More extortion charges, amounting to hundreds of thousands of rands, have since been added to the charge sheet by the State. It is being alleged that that it has taken a long time to crack down on these men’s alleged criminal activities, due to their links to high ranking cops in the province. “These allegations have been there for quite some time and police have been working very hard in terms of bringing these people to book. It’s not an easy task because you’ve got to work it deep in the belly. I salute those police officer who have remained loyal to the cause. As for those who are implicated or their names are being mentioned, it is not for us to theorise about it. We need to bring them to book,” Police Minister Fikile Mbalula said. Two dates have been set aside and the defence insists that even if the ill Kinnear is unable to attend, the case must continue without further delay. eNCA
