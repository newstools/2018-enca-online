"I am getting an impression that I am here in the arbitration about my character than anything else. "If this is about my character then I should have a lawyer. I am getting uncomfortable," Mahlangu said. Retired deputy chief justice Dikgang Moseneke told Mahlangu that his work is to chair the arbitration and assured her he would step in if she was being treated unfairly. A total of 143 psychiatric patients died after being moved from Life Esidimeni facilities to unlicensed NGOs. African News Agency
