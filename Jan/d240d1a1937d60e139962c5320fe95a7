The match will be broadcasted live on SuperSport 1. Benetton Rugby won both their festive fixtures against neighbours, Zebre but have not won three in a row in the Pro 14 since December 2012. The Cheetahs have lost just twice since round two, at home to Glasgow in October and away to Connacht in November. This is the two sides’ first meeting.  The Cheetahs will have to adapt from the South African summer to the winter temperatures in Italy and will have to take more of a physical approach in the cold and wet weather.  -- Fitness key to @GlasgowWarriors beating @CheetahsRugby says Fraser Brown.

Craig Barry moves to fullback, replacing Clayton Blommetjies who has been side-lined due to a cold. William Small-Smith will be starting on right wing.  Springboks Oupa Mohoje (flanker) and Uzair Cassiem (No. 8) are both in the starting lineup. Cassiem will be making his Pro 14 debut. Rynier Bernardo and Junior Pokomela will be providing cover on the bench. Tian Meyer is suffering from a groin injury, giving Zee Mkhabela the opportunity on the bench. The final nail in the @Ospreys' coffin
