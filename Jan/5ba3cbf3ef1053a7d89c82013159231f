CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance has called for next month's State of the Nation Address (SONA) to be postponed to allow Parliament to elect a new president of South Africa. In a statement on Wednesday, DA leader Mmusi Maimane said he had written to the Speaker of the National Assembly Baleka Mbete, requesting that this year’s SONA -- which is scheduled for Thursday 8 February -- be postponed until President Jacob Zuma has been removed from office, and Parliament is afforded an opportunity to elect a new president. "It is no secret that there is a battle within the ANC and the national executive with each side holding starkly differing policies, ideological positions and plans of action," Maimane said. "While Cyril Ramaphosa is the ANC President, Jacob Zuma remains President of South Africa, leaving the country not knowing which direction is being pursued."

"We cannot afford to waste this amount of public money for Zuma to deliver the government’s programme of action for the coming year in his SONA, when it is not likely that he will remain the President of the Republic much longer," he said. He added that according to the new rules of Parliament adopted last year, the institution is currently open for business, and does not require a SONA for the House and its committees to continue its work. "Therefore the Speaker must act in the interests of all South Africans, and postpone the State of the Nation Address until the ANC leadership battle has been resolved." African News Agency
