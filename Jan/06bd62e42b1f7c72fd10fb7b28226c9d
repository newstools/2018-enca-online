JOHANNESBURG - Questions are being asked about the role the Gauteng Department of Education played in the drama that has unfolded at Hoerskool Overvaal in Vereeniging. This week a court found that Hoërskool Overvaal was legally entitled to refuse to enrol 55 English-speaking pupils. This fuelled violent protests that have taken on racial undertones. Protesters have caused chaos outside the school for two days. On Wednesday, an ANC leader was shot in the face when police dispensed rubber bullets and on Thursday, a police van was allegedly petrol-bombed. A number of protesters have been arrested. The Huffington Post SA website has accused Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi of intimidating two nearby schools into claiming they did not have space for the children. The Gauteng Department of Education has denied that politics is behind its decision to appeal the court ruling about Hoerskool Overvaal. However, eNCA reporter Erin Bates points out that the court ruled that the Department of Education must pay the cost of its failed court bid because of its failure to adhere to procedures. A delegation from the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) has been monitoring the situation at Hoerskool Overvaal and has met with officials from the school, the police and demonstrators. The SAHRC has called on all parties to act with restraint and to ensure that demonstrations remain peaceful. eNCA
