JOHANNESBURG - Former DA leader Tony Leon has advised the party to end its ongoing public dispute over Cape Town Mayor Patricia De Lille's position. Leon says he knows from his experience that when the party starts factionalising and fighting in public that is a recipe for disaster. He says the DA, De Lile and City of Cape Town need to put the issue to rest.

"We are sitting in the midst of a drought and people want the leadership to focus on the essential task at hand," he says. "I think the people need to be reassured. From the broader DA perspective, they have a different national political picture, Ramaphosa’s election as ANC President has changed the position of the party and it has to be smart to adapt to the new reality. Having a fight in the City of Cape Town is not a good way to start the new year or to proceed with it," Leon says. De Lille has been accused of covering up alleged multimillion-rand fraud in the city's Foreshore Freeway Precinct tender and of mismanagement. She denies any wrongdoing and has promised to fight her accusers in court. In September, the party put her on special leave, and an inquiry was established to examine the political management of Cape Town. eNCA
