JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi says it's all hands on deck for his department as it tries to ensure all pupils have been allocated a school. Gauteng schools reopen on Wednesday for 2018. READ: Lesufi happy with progress of 2018 school placements “The education system in our province is officially under siege. We have no choice but to recall all our officials to assist us to ensure that these learners are placed before the end of February. That’s where we’re having a huge huge problem,” says Lesufi. eNCA
