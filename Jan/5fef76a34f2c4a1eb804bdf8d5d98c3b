JOHANNESBURG – The African National Congress (ANC)’S National Executive Committee (NEC) on Monday afternoon gave a briefing on the outcomes of its weekend lekgotla. It is believed the ANC NEC had the tough task of discussing the future of President Jacob Zuma as head of state. Magashule (on free education for the poor); ‘The funding model - we’ve agreed that in the five years we will be phasing in gradually the issue of funding. It will happen because it’s a resolution of government. We’re leaving modalities to government’ #ANCNEC Magashule; (On Zuma matter); ‘The officials were seized with this matter & will remain seized with this matter. We’d said there’d be continuous interaction between President Zuma & President Ramaphosa. There isn’t any rumour or move to remore President Zuma’ #ANCNEC Magashule; ‘The #ANCNEC discussed this matter (of Zuma), and we all agreed this matter is with the officials: President Zuma and President Ramaphosa. And there are no timelines’ Magashule; ‘Wherever there is corruption, let the law take its place, whether it’s #Vrede dairy or any other thing’ #ANCNEC Sources told eNCA the lekgotla tasked the ANC’s top six to deal with the matter.
