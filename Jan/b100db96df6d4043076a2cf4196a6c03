JOHANNESBURG - The JSE closed weaker on Tuesday as global concern affected market sentiment‚ with the local banking sector affected by a report released by Viceroy‚ implicating Capitec Bank in reckless lending and understating its bad loans. The JSE closed below 60‚000 points for the first time in almost three weeks. A drop in Naspers’s share price also dragged the market lower‚ as Chinese internet company Tencent‚ of which it owned about a third‚ lost two percent in Hong Kong trade. Despite upbeat GDP numbers released in the US on Friday‚ and the prospects of only measured interest-rate increases in 2018‚ investors are increasingly becoming uneasy about a reversal in the bond market. READ: 'We are open for business': Capitec's full response to Viceroy US yields have increased to more than three-year highs‚ raising borrowing costs. The consequences are difficult to foresee at present but in the past, they have led to economic contraction if not managed prudently. Central banks are starting to tighten monetary policy by increasing interest rates‚ so the era of ultra-cheap money may be slowly coming to an end. BlackRock said in its weekly comment on Tuesday there was room for the US Federal Reserve to lift rates four times this year‚ rather than the three it has signalled. “This is still a gradual pace‚ but brings the cycle’s recessionary tipping point forward by about a year.” Locally‚ Viceroy Research finally released its latest report on a South African company‚ this time banking group Capitec was its target. A previous Viceroy report on Steinhoff led to an implosion of its share price‚ which plummeted about 90 percent.

Capitec shares slumped as much as 24 percent at one stage‚ but pared losses in late trade after the Reserve Bank said, “Capitec was solvent‚ well capitalised and had adequate liquidity.” Viceroy labelled the bank a “loan shark with massively understated defaults” and simply “uninvestable”. In its defence‚ Capitec said in a statement it was studying the report‚ but on the face of it‚ the content was inaccurate.
