JOHANNESBURG - Sars has denied former British Cabinet Minister Peter Hain's claim that one of its senior officials was involved in suspicious transactions made in US dollars. The revenue services says the money was sent to Sars Deputy Commissioner Jonas Makwakwa by relatives in Zimbabwe. READ: Hain wants action taken against Hogan Lovells "The difficult thing is we’ve asked parliament to help us release that report, so perceptions can be cleared. Parliament is working on a process to release this report to the public. Even the money that comes from Zimbabwe was explained," says Luther Lebelo from Sars. "Mr Mokokwa has a family in Zimbabwe but there are simple explanations that passed the test of employment relations. We hope Hawks to move faster on this matter.We can’t every time that some raises allegations against someone we suspend that person,” he says. eNCA
