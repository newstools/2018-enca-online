CAPE TOWN - Cape Town City on Tuesday announced the signing of Ugandan international forward Allan Kateregga. Kateregga, who plays on the wing, has been turning out for Uganda Premier League Champions KCCA FC and is yet another addition to the Cape Town side's squad. Altogether the club has now made four signings in the January transfer window. And good news for City fans is that management is still after two more players before the transfer window closes on January 31.

The club feels that with Kateregga's experience, he has the ability to move around the forward line and is apparently comfortable playing on either flank or down the middle. African News Agency
