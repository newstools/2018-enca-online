JOHANNESBURG - The newly elected ANC National Executive Committee has reportedly tasked the party's top six officials with managing President Jacob Zuma's exit from the government. Political analyst Ongama Mtimka says this may be an indication that party dynamics are changing. "If the stories are to be believed that the NEC has decided the president should be removed, that’s a strong indication that power has shifted. The president has been very powerful. This has been a president who’s shown strong power very strongly, that power has shifted but I don’t think the message that’s coming out will be received well by people who see the Zuma presidency having created a constitutional crisis in the country," says Mtimka. The ANC NEC is locked behind closed doors in Irene, Pretoria. eNCA
