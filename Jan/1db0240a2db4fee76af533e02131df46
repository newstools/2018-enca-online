Editor’s note: The livestream is now over. You may watch a recording above. JOHANNESBURG - South Africa’s power supplier is on the brink of collapse. Eskom is set to release its delayed financial results on Tuesday, under pressure to keep it profitable. With only R1.5-billion barely holding the company's solvency together, its turnaround appears to be 'mission impossible'. In 2001, Eskom was named Global Power Company of the Year with a record 30,399MW peak demand, seemingly a healthy company and one of the best utilities in the world. Seventeen years later, the parastatal is short-circuiting, with cap in hand trying to raise R20-billion needed to survive until March. READ: Moody's keeps Eskom under review One analyst said it is not only about the numbers, but about how interim CEO Phakamani Hadebe delivers the results. “It’s also about credibility and how they are delivered, but the numbers are important because they need to be backed by auditors,” said economist Ian Cruickshanks. Compounding Eskom’s problems is energy regulator Nersa's rejection of the 19 percent tariff increase that would have improved its cash flow. Now it has to operate on the 5.2 percent that was granted. With a high wage bill and operating costs, this could prove difficult.

Is there an option? Yes, government can be an option," said Cruickshanks. But Treasury already made it clear it cannot back up the national energy provider, especially as it faces a R50-billion revenue shortfall in February. The JSE has threatened to stop trading the parastatal's bonds, but even the value of those is under threat with Moody’s pushing Eskom into junk status making any debts it acquires even more expensive to pay back. eNCA
