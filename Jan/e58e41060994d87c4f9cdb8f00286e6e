EAST LONDON - ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) member Jessie Duarte has criticised US President Donald Trump's comments on immigrants. Trump on Thursday questioned why the United States would want to have immigrants from Haiti and African nations and would instead prefer immigrants from Norway, referring to some as "s***hole countries", according to two sources familiar with the comments. Duarte made the comments on the sidelines of the state of readiness address for the ANCâ€™s 106 birthday celebrations at the weekend. "Ours is not a sh****le country and neither is Haiti or any other country in distress," she said. eNCA
