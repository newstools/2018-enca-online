JOHANNESBURG – Higher Education Minister Hlengiwe Mkhize will on Thursday morning brief the public about 2018 registration process at various institutions.

In response, Mkhize accused EFF leader Julius Malema of making reckless political statements. She further described Malema’s call as ‘unrealistic’.
