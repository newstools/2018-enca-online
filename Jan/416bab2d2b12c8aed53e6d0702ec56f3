JOHANNESBURG - Farm and factory gate inflation‚ as measured by the annual change in the producer price index (PPI)‚ accelerated slightly to 5.2 percent in December from 5.1 percent in November. The PPI averaged 4.8 percent in 2017‚ down sharply from seven percent in 2016. The rise was similar to December’s consumer price index (CPI)‚ which accelerated to 4.7 percent from 4.6 percent in November. The food component of PPI decelerated to one percent from November’s 1.9 percent‚ with wholesale meat prices moderating to 12.6 percent in December from the same month in 2016. In November‚ meat inflation was 13.5 percent‚ Statistics SA reported on Thursday. Electricity prices dropped to 2.1 percent from three percent while water price inflation remained at 10.5 percent. READ: Inflation expected to continue downward trend FNB chief economist Mamello Matikinca projected that the December PPI would moderate back toward the five percent year-on-year level‚ after which it is set to track sideways to slightly higher for most of 2018. Investec economist Kamilla Kaplan said she expected PPI to have lifted to 5.2 percent. “In line with CPI, the slightly higher rate of inflation would have been driven by renewed upward fuel price pressures.” In December‚ petrol and diesel prices rose by 71c and 60c per litre‚ respectively‚ on the combination of a higher international oil price and a weaker rand. The Bloomberg consensus was 5.1 percent while macro-economics website Trading Economics forecast five percent. iNet Bridge
