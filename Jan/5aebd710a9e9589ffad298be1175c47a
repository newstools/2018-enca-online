EAST LONDON - ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule has described as fake news claims that President Jacob Zuma has put down conditions in exchange for his resignation. The Mail & Gaurdian reported that Zuma wants former African Union (AU) commission chair Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma made interim president and that David Mahlobo must be retained as energy minister. WATCH: Zuma resignation speculation rife Speculation about Zuma’s future in government has been mounting since the end of the ANC’s elective conference in December. The ANC secretary general told reporters the nation will be notified in due course. "Write objectively, without fear or favour, but don’t create or come with fake news. There is no substance that the former AU Chairperson will be the president,” Magashule added. The ANC says it is ready for its 8 January statement on Saturday. The party adds this will be the first step towards proving it is worthy of leading the country again come the 2019 elections. eNCA
