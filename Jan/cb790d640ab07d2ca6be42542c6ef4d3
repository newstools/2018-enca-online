JOHANNESBURG - After days of wiping sweat from their brows, there is finally some relief for South Africans as the heatwave has broken.  In Gauteng, temperatures soared to 35 degrees Celsius and above as sweltering conditions persisted for nearly a week.  Moisture has now pushed in over the eastern part of the country, bringing cloud and cooler weather to the area. But, residents in Gauteng and western Limpopo should now brace themselves for widespread thunderstorms on Tuesday.  WATCH: Many flock to swimming pools as heatwave hits SA "Intense rainfall and hail are possible in the afternoon and evening. The SA Weather Service has even issued a severe weather watch for severe thunderstorm development," said the head of eNCA's weather department, Candice McKechnie.  The weather will be cooler on Wednesday but the mercury will start rising again from Thursday into the weekend.  "A few isolated thunderstorms remain for Gauteng on Wednesday but the weather will be partly cloudy and dry into the weekend," said McKechnie. eNCA
