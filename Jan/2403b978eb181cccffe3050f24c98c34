JOHANNESBURG - The bail application of former crime intelligence officer Morris Tshabalala, known as Captain KGB, will continue at the Pretoria Magistrate's Court on Friday morning. Tshabalala, who was arrested by police watchdog IPID on Tuesday, is believed to work in Crime Intelligence despite a prior criminal conviction and being out on parole. He allegedly stole R563,000 from the SAPS secret slush fund meant for operational purposes. But his employment status left the court baffled during his first appearance on Thursday. Despite claims of being unemployed, Tshabalala drove a state issued vehicle from the crime intelligence bureau. His lawyer has asked the courts to proceed with caution because the alleged officer is involved with country's security affairs. eNCA
