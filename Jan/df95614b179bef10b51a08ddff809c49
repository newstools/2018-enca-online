CAPE TOWN - Cape Town Mayor, Patricia de Lille has dodged another bullet. After the ANC withdrew its motion of no confidence in her, speculation was rife that the Democratic Alliance (DA) would bring one of its own. But this failed to materialise. Patricia de Lille remains in office for now. Wednesday could’ve been her last day in office, but it was not to be. The ANC says it's clear de Lille has been made a scapegoat by the party she serves.

The DA’s expected motion didn’t pan out, though. Earlier this month, DA leader, Mmusi Maimane, said such a motion would be premature given the Federal Legal Commission’s investigation of the charges against her. It seems the party has backtracked on that position. In a statement, de Lille says the DA's desperation to get rid of her has reached new heights and that she remains at the receiving end of - what she calls - constant attacks from her colleagues. It's yet unclear what the DA's next move will be. eNCA
