JOHANNESBURG - Hugh Masekela's sister, Barbara, says the jazz icon fought his illness bravely. The 78-year-old world renowned artist passed away on Tuesday after a battle with cancer. Barbara thanked the doctors who took care of her brother. Sunday's memorial at the University of Johannesburg's Soweto Campus was the final public event for the jazz icon. Masekela's close friend, Gabby Magomola, said his life was built around loving and caring for others. Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa says Masekela's death is not just a loss for the country, but for the world. Composer Caiphus Semenya says Masekela would have wanted to be bid farewell through song. Semenya and other artists, including musicians and poets, paid tribute at Sunday's event. eNCA
