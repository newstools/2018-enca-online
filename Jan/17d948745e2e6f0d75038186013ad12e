JOHANNESBURG – Archbishop Thabo Makgoba on Sunday came out guns blazing against corruption in both the public and private sector. Preaching at the 106th anniversary of the St Paul’s church in Cape Town, he described the behaviour in both sectors as a “sin of selfless greed.” The cleric was targetting both the Steinhoff retail group and the Gupta family alike in his sermon. "Two wrongs do not make a right. Corruption or dodgy dealings in one part of the private sector (Steinhoff) does not justify it in another (the Guptas). Both are to be condemned, equally," Makgoba said.

"Neither government investigators and prosecutors nor private sector regulators and professionals in fields such as auditing and accounting, have called to account both the criminals in the private sector and the officials and politicians in the public sector, who they facilitate with their misdeeds," the archbishop added. eNCA
