JOHANNESBURG – The SA Weather Service has called Western Cape Premier Helen Zille opportunistic and disingenuous. Zille reportedly blamed the water crisis in her province on the SA Weather Service getting predictions “all wrong” and went on to claim models “didn’t work, in an era of climate change”. The SA Weather Service, in a stinging statement, said it had spoken to the Premier and asked her to refrain from casting aspersions in public.
