DURBAN - The African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) will hold its elective conference between March and April 2018. ANC secretary general Ace Magashule made the announcement while briefing the media on Tuesday. #Magashule We will meet structures in KZN & Free State to inform them of #ANCNEC decision, then give names of those in interim structures Earlier, the ANC dissolved the KZN provincial leadership along with the Free State, a move welcomed at the time by the ANC in the province. This after a court in 2017 ruled that the 2015 conference that elected Sihle Zikalala as chairperson was illegitimate. It meant the ANC's leadership in that province could not attend the party's elective congress in December in any official capacity, unless they were attending as normal branch delegates.
