JOHANNESBURG – Wits University general workers on Friday continued with their strike over wage disputes. The Nehawu- and Numsa-affiliated workers say months of talking to university management have failed to bear fruit. The unions are demanding an eight to 12-percent wage hike, but the university is only offering six-percent. Officials at the university say the strike has been peaceful so far.
