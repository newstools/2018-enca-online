JOHANNESBURG – It is business as usual but with very tight security at the flagship H&M branch in Sandton City in northern Johannesburg following a damaging protest on Saturday. Members of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) raided the store, along with other of their shops nationwide, knocking over merchandise and mannequins in an anti-racism protest. The Swedish retailer came under fire after an ad showed a black boy wearing a hoodie that read “coolest monkey in the jungle”, prompting outrage.
