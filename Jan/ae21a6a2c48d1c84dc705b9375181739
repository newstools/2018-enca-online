WASHINGTON - Award-winning gospel singer Edwin Hawkins, best known for a hit arrangement of "Oh Happy Day," has died at the age of 74. Credited with being one of the founders of modern gospel music, Hawkins died Monday at his California home after battling pancreatic cancer, US media reported, quoting the artist's publicist, Bill Carpenter. "Oh Happy Day" is an 18th century hymn which Hawkins arranged in a call and response style.
