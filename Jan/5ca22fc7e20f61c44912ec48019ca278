JOHANNESBURG - Wouter Basson - the apartheid-era chemical warfare expert dubbed Dr Death - has won a legal challenge in the matter of his Health Professions Council (HPCSA) disciplinary hearing. He wants two members of the review committee that is deciding his sanction dismissed. In 2007, while practising as a cardiologist, Basson was charged with unprofessional conduct. The HPCSA argued that his participation in the army's apartheid-era chemical and biological warfare programme violated the rules on ethics for physicians. In December 2013, he was found guilty. WATCH: Inside 'Dr Death's' eerie laboratory Basson appealed to the high court, which instructed him to exhaust the internal processes of the HPCSA. That decision has now been overturned by the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein. The North Gauteng High Court will now have to make a ruling on the review application. eNCA
