ZIMBABWE - Zimbabwe’s former First Lady could be facing arrest. The country’s corruption watchdog says it’s probing several allegations against Grace Mugabe, including reports that she’s in possession of a fake degree. Mugabe holds a Phd in Sociology from the University of Zimbabwe. She was allegedly awarded the degree after barely two months at the institution.

They have made allegations and the Zimbabwe AntiCorruption Commission is making an investigation. When we finished the investigation we will do what we are supposed to do in terms of the law,” says Goodson Nguni, Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission Chairperson. Nguni says it’s also probing the role of university officials. “If anybody falsifies anything you will see them coming to court. The people who misrepresented to the University, the people who misrepresented to the whole nation about that whole degree thing, we are going to investigate the matter and follow the law," he says.
