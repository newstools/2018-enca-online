EASTERN CAPE - Nelson Mandela's grandson, Mandla Mandela, has called for an inquest into the deaths of anti-apartheid activists Stompie Seipei and Abu-Baker Asvat in 1989. He made the call in a statement welcoming a Supreme Court of Appeal judgment on Madiba's Qunu home. Seipei was a member of the Mandela Football Club who was 14 when he was killed. Doctor Asvat was shot dead in his Soweto clinic. The SCA earlier dismissed Winnie Madikizela-Mandela’s latest legal bid for her former husband's Qunu home. She challenged Madiba’s decision to leave the home to his third wife, Graca Machel, and her children. The court dismissed Madikizela-Mandela’s appeal on the grounds that there was an unreasonable delay in instituting legal action. Madikizela-Mandela was implicated in Seipei's death but has consistently maintained her innocence. eNCA
