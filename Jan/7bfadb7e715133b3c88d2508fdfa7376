JOHANNESBURG - EFF Spokesperson, Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, says a different approach is needed to impeach President Jacob Zuma. Parliament is drafting new rules of impeachment. READ: Opposition parties celebrate ConCourt ruling on Zuma “We have to find a different mechanism in which decisions can be taken and not through majoritarianism. But also experts where legal representation can be made to establish that there are grounds in relation to section 89 or whether those grounds tabled in section 89 exist,” says Ndlozi. On Wednesday Parliament's rules committe met to set out presidential impeachment rules, as instructed by the Constitutional Court. The Constitutional Court on Friday,  in a majority decision, found that Parliament failed to hold President Jacob Zuma accountable over the Nkandla issue. It said Parliament has 120 days to decide what the rules of impeachment against Zuma are going to be and within 120 days thereafter, they need to act on those rules on the president. eNCA
