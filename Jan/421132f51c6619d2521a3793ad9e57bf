JOHANNESBURG – Oxfam South Africa has released its annual global inequality report ahead of the World Economic Forum in Davos. The gap between the rich and the poor globally appears to be growing by the hour, according to Oxfam’s report. The confederation of charitable organisations has since urged global leaders to address the crisis. The old adage - the rich are getting richer and the poor, poorer - couldn’t ring more true for 2017. Last year, every second day, a billionaire was created in the world. It is the biggest increase in the number of billionaires ever seen. Nine out of 10 are men and in South Africa, the rich and poor are also worlds apart. It takes almost four-and-half days for the best paid executive at Shoprite to earn what a temporary farm worker at a vineyard in South Africa will earn in their lifetime. These are some of the shocking facts highlighted in the report. As world leaders head off to the Alpine town, many are hoping it is going to be more than just a talk in dealing with inequality.

We are saying it is important that they sit back and take stock of what the reality is. The reality is we have a broken economy that continues to work for only one percent of the global population, while the majority of people suffer,” Oxfam SA’s Siphokazi Mthathi said. Oxfam plans on meeting with leaders to try and tackle issues highlighted in the report. “We produce this report so that we can shine a mirror on the problem that persists but also offer solutions that we think could be adopted. We use it in a way to inspire government and other stakeholders.”
	The organisation says concrete time-bound targets and plans of action need to be top priority. The report also highlights the need to develop more human economies that have greater equality as a primary aim. eNCA
