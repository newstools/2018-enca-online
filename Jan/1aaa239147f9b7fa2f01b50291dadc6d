CAPE TOWN – The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) called on Wednesday for Cape Town to introduce emergency by-laws for groundwater sharing when the city becomes the first in the world to run dry after water restrictions become insufficient amid a three-year drought. “Life beyond Day Zero will present exceptional circumstances and we hope that emergency by-laws will be brought in to enable Capetonians to use and share groundwater with neighbours for more uses in order to relieve the burden on the city’s emergency points of distribution (PoDs),” WWF said in a press release.

On Tuesday, the city’s deputy mayor, Ian Neilson‚ who has taken over management of the water crisis from mayor Patricia de Lille‚ said Day Zero was coming earlier than expected, on 12 April, unless Capetonians reduced their water use immediately by 25 percent. Day Zero was previously set at 21 April. Neilson said only 41 percent of the city’s occupants were using less than 87 litres of water a day, making the new restrictions from 1 February vital. The region’s dam levels had fallen further over the past week and now stood at a mere 27.2 percent of capacity. African News Agency
