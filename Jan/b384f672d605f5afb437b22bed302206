Then on the first day, the venue at Constitution Hill was menaced with dark clouds, pouring rain and hail that left the show grounds covered in mud, frustrating the very eager festival goers. But on Sunday, the sun was out again and great weather prevailed, allowing South Africans to truly pull out all the stops with creative, colourful and exciting looks for the festival.
