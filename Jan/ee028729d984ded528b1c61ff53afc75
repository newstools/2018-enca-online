The agency currently rates Cape Town, along with South Africa, as one level above junk status. It said if the city's water woes persist it is unlikely that Cape Town will be able to maintain its conservative debt management policies. WATER CALCULATOR: What it's going to take to stick to Cape Town's water limits Analysts at the agency said that two of Cape Townâ€™s main industries - tourism and agriculture - are likely to decline and reduce employment.
