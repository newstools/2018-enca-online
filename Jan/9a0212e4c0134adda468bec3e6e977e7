JOHANNESBURG – South Africa’s Kevin Anderson has hired new coach Brad Stine, it was confirmed on Wednesday. “I‘m excited to tell you all that I am working with Brad Stine this year!,” said Anderson on his Facebook page. “We’ve had a great start already and he’ll be joining me in 2018 as my coach on tour as we work toward more great results.” Anderson earlier on Wednesday reached the quarter-finals of the ATP Maharashtra Open in Pune. Stine coached former world number one Jim Courier during the mid-90s and has since mentored Sebastien Grosjean and Byron Black. Anderson split with his previous coach Neville Godwin in November. The 31-year-old Anderson had an incredible run in the US Open last year where made it to the final before losing to Spain’s Rafael Nadal in September. Anderson, at the time, was the world No 32, was the lowest-ranked US Open men’s singles finalist since the inception of the ATP rankings in 1973. The South African started the season at No 80 in the ATP Rankings after an injury-ravaged 2016. It was his lowest mark since August 2010. Anderson reached a career-high ranking of 10th in October 2015 soon after beating Britain’s Andy Murray to reach the US Open quarterfinals. African News Agency
