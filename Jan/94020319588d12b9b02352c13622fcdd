JOHANNESBURG – Firefighters were blocked from responding to a house on fire after their vehicle collided with two vehicles which had blocked a road in Mailula section in Vosloorus on New Year’s day. “The owners of the two vehicles, supported by a good number of partygoers, stopped the fire engine and threatened the firefighters and even took the fire engine’s key, preventing it from proceeding to its intended destination,” Ekurhuleni Disaster and Emergency Management Services (DEMS) said in a statement on Tuesday.
