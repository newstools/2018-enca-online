Lesufi says the department will be dealing with queries next weekend 13 and 14 Jan. "Because we anticipate a huge volume of parents that feel they haven’t received the final confirmation, we have dedicated Saturday and Sunday for all walk ins. So if a parent has not received a placement in all our districts you can walk in and make an enquiry and we will be able to tell you we have placed your child here," says Lesufi. eNCA
