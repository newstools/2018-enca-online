JOHANNESBURG - The Film and Publication Board is urging parents to be wary of posting pictures of their children on social media. It says this may result in sexual predators targeting their children. According to Abongile Mashele of the Film and Publication Board, "It's unlike in the days of our parents whenÂ taking a photo was solely for the purposes of putting it in a family album. These days when you take an image and post it on social media you are basically publishing an image of your child and if you don't have the necessary privacy settings on your account you are publishing it to the greater internet or the World Wide Web. "The biggest challenge we have is that the parents don't put the necessary privacy settings to ensure that the people who have access to the settings are people they trust. "Secondly, they don't hide the names of the school so it's easy to identify exactly where that child is located. "Thirdly, parents of other children may not consent to have their children's images published. We thought we should highlight to parents that even though you are happy and proud, just follow make sure you follow precautions," he said. Social media analyst Yavi Madurai says parents should be vigilant when posting pictures of their children on social media platforms. eNCA
