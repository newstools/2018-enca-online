JOHANNESBURG – The tribunal investigating the conduct of Judge Nkola Motata continues on Thursday at the Office of the Chief Justice in Midrand. The probe is looking at Motata’s conduct after he drove his Jaguar into a wall of a home in Hurlingham, north of Johannesburg, 11 years ago. Motata was summoned to appear before the tribunal in June 2013, but proceedings were postponed following an application by Motata. READ: Another court failure for drunk-driving judge Motata He was accused of making racist comments at the scene of the crash. Motata was convicted of drunk driving in 2009. At the scene of the crash, he allegedly told property owner Richard Baird that: “No boer is going to undermine me. This used to be the white man’s land, but it isn’t any more.” Motata was fined R20,000 and in 2010, his appeal  against his drunk driving conviction failed. Should the now retired Motata be impeached, he risks losing his salary, allowances and benefits. eNCA
