JOHANNESBURG - Passengers onboard a flight to Johannesburg were surprised when the pilot engaged the emergency brakes as they were about to take off from King Shaka airport in Durban. Mango Airlines confirmed that its flight JE 285 from Durban to Johannesburg experienced a delay of about 20 minutes on Wednesday afternoon at King Shaka International Airport.
