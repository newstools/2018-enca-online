PRETORIA - There were chaotic scenes at Unisa's Sunnyside campus in Pretoria on Monday, as thousands of prospective students crowded outside the gates for walk-in applications. On Friday, the university made a decision to allow walk-in applications for first-time undergraduates after demonstrations by the EFF Student Command and the ANC Youth League. Outside the campus gates, members of the Progressive Youth Alliance (PYA) held a protest, demanding to know when Unisa would implement President Jacob Zuma's promise of free tertiary education. #UnisaProtest: Students are pushing their way into the resignations center at Unisa, this comes after demonstrations by the #PYA.

Some prospective applicants were seen scaling the walls to enter the campus. There were disagreements between the two student groups, with the EFF Student Command insisting applicants should be allowed in on Monday, while the PYA agreed with the university that they should return on Tuesday. #UnisaProtest: Unisa management says students should go home and come back tomorrow to register.
