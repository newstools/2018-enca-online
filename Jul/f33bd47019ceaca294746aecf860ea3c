JOHANNESBURG - The death toll from Saturday night's taxi shooting near Colenso in the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Midlands has risen to 12. On Monday, National Police Commissioner Khehla Sitole said it’s too early to have established a motive for the mass killing that saw 255 bullets fired at a taxi carrying taxi drivers coming from a funeral for a taxi boss who was among three people gunned down in Tembisa in Gauteng last week. Also on Monday, another taxi boss was shot and killed in Alexandra, Johannesburg.
