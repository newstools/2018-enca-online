"It's a great feeling and very good for the team. I have my chances to win tomorrow too and also at the Roubaix," said Van Avermaet. READ: Security tight as Froome lines up for Tour de France The Belgian fans were quick to point out that one of their riders would be wearing the Tour de France yellow jersey on the day their team play France in football's World Cup semi-finals. It was also a very satisfying day for Froome, the Kenyan-born Briton ignoring some booing at the start line and working with his team to make up some of the valuable time he lost on Saturday's first stage.
