JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) has called a special Federal Executive (FedEx) meeting for this weekend at their new headquarters in Johannesburg after a number of senior party Members of Parliament (MPs) and Members of Provincial Legislatures (MPLs) objected to provincial leaders sitting in on their interviews to return to their deployments. Seven Provincial leaders, excluding Western Cape Leader Bonginkosi Madikizela, have threatened to resign if they are excluded from the selection panels of the party’s interviews for MPs and MPLs. #DAFedEx Here are some of the extracts of the letter these ‘Senior’ Members of Parliament and Legislatures have sent to DA Leaders attending the Special FedEx Tomorrow.
