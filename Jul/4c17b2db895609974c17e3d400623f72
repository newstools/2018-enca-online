JOHANNESBURG - The AA proved correct in predicting that the price of petrol will increase by 26 cents a litre on Wednesday. The Minister of Energy, Jeff Radebe, on Sunday announced that the petrol price would rise by 26c on Wednesday. Petrol was already at an all-time high after June's increase of 82 cents a litre and another fuel price hike is expected to hit already-reeling consumers hard. The main reasons given for the fuel price adjustments were: - the depreciation of the rand against the dollar- this had the most significant impact with the currency deteriorating from an average R12.51 to the dollar, to R13.29 to the dollar; a decrease for the period in the price of crude oil; and a decrease in the import price of petroleum products. The fuel prices for July 2018 will be adjusted as follows  Petrol (93 Octane, ULP and LRP): 26.00 c/l increase;
	 Petrol (95 Octane, ULP and LRP): 23.00 c/l increase;
