JOHANNESBURG – The African National Congress (ANC)'s spokesperson, Pule Mabe insisted the  KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) provincial conference will proceed on Thursday. This as disgruntled members once again approached the High Court in Pietermaritzburg to stop the elective conference. However, that legal bid has failed. Earlier, Mabe insisted the delays at the conference is due to logistical challenges only. On Thursday morning, Provincial Task Team coordinator Sihle Zikalala maintained the conference would proceed. However, the court bid had clearly put a spanner in the works for the ANC. Earlier, KZN's Provincial Task Team Convener Mike Mabuyakhulu said: “We are convinced the court will rule in our favour... The current application is a mirror image of what we've already dealt with." By Thursday night, the Conference managed to get underway. eNCA
