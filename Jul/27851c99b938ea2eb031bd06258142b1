DUBLIN - Britain's Prince Harry confidently predicted that England would lift the World Cup as Gareth Southgate's men prepare for their semi-final against Croatia later on Wednesday. Asked if football is coming home during a visit to the Irish President's residence in Dublin -- a reference to England's 1996 soccer anthem "Three Lions" -- Harry replied "most definitely." Harry and his American wife Meghan began a two-day visit to Dublin on Tuesday, their first trip abroad since their wedding in May. Harry, whose brother William is the President of Englandâ€™s Football Association, is due to leave Ireland later on Wednesday and return home in time for the 1800 GMT kick off in Moscow. Reuters
