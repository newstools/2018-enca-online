JOHANNESBURG – The Premier Soccer League (PSL) has confirmed the official dates for the opening fixtures of the Absa Premiership 2018/19 season, but there is still confusion around the proposed start of the season as Ajax Cape Town and the PSL are at loggerheads in the Tendai Ndoro saga. According to the PSL, the league is scheduled to start on 4 August with defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns hosting Kaizer Chiefs at the Loftus Versfeld stadium.

The PSL has announced that it will appeal that ruling but it’s hard to see how this can be resolved before the planned 4 August start date.

If you look at the programme of Caf and the congestedness of the league programme currently, it will affect not only the kickoff but the whole season programme.” eNCA
