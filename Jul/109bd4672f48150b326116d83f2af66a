JOHANNESBURG – Numsa's general secretary Irvin Jim's concerned about various media reports that cash-strapped Eskom's been splurging money on senior staff. Executives have allegedly been receiving unlimited free petrol. UPDATE: Eskom ups its wage offer “There have been a couple of issues that worried us. I mean last week we would have appreciated that the Business Day would have revealed a couple of serious stuff around packs for managers, and the senior employment of another person who is going to be very expensive….we’re here objectively to negotiate,” said Jim. eNCA
