EFF party spokesperson, Mbuyiseni Ndlozi pointed out that after the party lost a court case requiring it to pay a steep registration fee, Mazzotti came forward and helped the party with funding. He said the party had no knowledge of Mazzotti's chequered past, and to this day the party considers it to be nothing more than rumours in the media. *View the attached video where Ndlozi further explains his party's relationship to Mazzotti. eNCA
