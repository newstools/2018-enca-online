JOHANNESBURG – South African fast bowler Kagiso Rabada says he is fit and raring to go ahead of the first Test match against Sri Lanka starting in Galle on Thursday. “The No1 ranked ICC Test bowler has fully recovered from the lower back injury he sustained in April, and is hungry to return to action after the layoff,” SA Cricket said in a statement. The player also confirmed his condition after the team practice in Galle. “I am feeling quite good, so far so good,” he said.
