JOHANNESBURG - Thousands of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) community members paraded in celebration of gay pride across the world this weekend. Tens of thousands of mainly young people flooded the streets of central Paris for the annual Gay Pride parade on Saturday, with plenty of exuberance but also calls to "carry on the struggle" against discrimination. The marchers wound their way through the French capital under the traditional rainbow colours of the LGBT community.
