BUDAPEST, Hungary – Lewis Hamilton cruised to a dominant fifth win of the season in his Mercedes in Sunday's Hungarian Grand Prix to extend his championship lead over Sebastian Vettel to 24 points. The defending world champion came home 17.123 seconds ahead of title rival and fellow four-time champion Vettel of Ferrari after the German had survived a collision with Valtteri Bottas, in the second Mercedes. That came on lap 65, of the 70, when Vettel finally passed Bottas, but the Finn’s right front wing touched his rear left tyre under braking, damaging his front wing and wrecking Mercedes’ hopes of a one-two finish. -- LEWIS HAMILTON WINS THE HUNGARIAN GRAND PRIX! --
