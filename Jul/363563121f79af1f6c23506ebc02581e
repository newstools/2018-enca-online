JOHANNESBURG – The Big Mac Index - as it is known - says the rand is undervalued by over 57 percent. The index was created in 1986 as a lighthearted guide to whether currencies are at their 'correct' level. The Big Mac burger, sold by fast food chain McDonalds, is hugely popular worldwide. The index uses the burger for comparisons because it is available in almost every country.

A Big Mac burger costs R31 in South Africa versus $5.51 in the United States. That means there is an implied exchange rate of R5.63 cents to the US dollar. Of course, we know the actual exchange rate is between R13.30 and R13.35. That suggests the South African rand is 57.9 percent undervalued according to the index. The Big Mac Index is released annually by The Economist magazine. eNCA
