LIVERPOOL - Striker Daniel Sturridge wants to stay at Liverpool and fight for a starting role under manager Jurgen Klopp at the Premier League club, the 28-year-old has said. Sturridge has been hampered by a spate of injuries during the last few years with the England international passing the 10-goal mark only once over the last four seasons, scoring 13 in the 2015-16 season.

Local media reports linked Sturridge with a move away from Liverpool but manager Klopp said this week that the striker still has a future at Anfield. "I see myself staying at Liverpool, hopefully being part of the team week in, week out," Sturridge told the Daily Mirror. "Pre-season is going well, so for me it's keeping my head down and building on that. I'm excited about the season ahead and it feels great to be back."
