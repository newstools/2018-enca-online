JOHANNESBURG â€“ Kaizer Chiefs have appointed Giovanni Solinas as their new head coach. The 50-year-old Italian replaces Steve Komphela who resigned before the end of last season due to poor results. Chiefs have not won any silverware since the departure of Stuart Baxter in 2015. Baxter, the current Bafana Bafana coach, was heavily linked with a return to the Chiefs bench but the Naturena based club have secured the services of Solinas who has previously coached Free State Stars in the Premier Soccer League. eNCA
