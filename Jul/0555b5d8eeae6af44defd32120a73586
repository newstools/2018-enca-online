JOHANNESBURG – The case against the man accused of raping and murdering six-year-old Stacey Adams has been postponed again. The suspect made a brief appearance in the Mitchells Plain Magistrate’s Court in Cape Town on Tuesday. Adams was reported missing late last month. Her body was found in a shallow grave just metres from her Eastridge home hours later. The accused is yet to plead. The case has been postponed to the 16th of August for a bail application. The Adams family, the community, and the State are all opposing the bail.
