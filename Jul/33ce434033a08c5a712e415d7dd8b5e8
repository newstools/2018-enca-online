JOHANNESBURG – A survey shows that Zimbabwe’s elections, set for next week, will be a close contest between President Emmerson Mnangagwa and Movement for Democratic Chance (MDC) leader Nelson Chamisa but analysts predict the elections are far from a thing of free, fair and credible exercise. Speaking to eNCA's Thulasizwe Simelane, political analyst Ibbo Mandaza said the likelihood of the elections being free and fair will be hindered by issues of legacy. “As things stand, clearly the elections are far from being free, fair, and credible exercise,” Mandanza said. Asked about some of the issues of concern, Mandaza said legacy issues and the previous records of elections are testimonials that elections in the country are not free and fair.
