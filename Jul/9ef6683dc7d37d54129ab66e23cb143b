JOHANNESBURG – uMkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association spokesperson Carl Niehaus has accused former president Kgalema Motlanthe of attacking traditional leaders.
	
	Motlanthe was head of a high-level panel, which recommended that land under the Ingonyama Trust be expropriated and the trust be scrapped. Motlanthe made remarks that traditional leaders are “tin-pot village dictators,” words that have not gone down well with many traditional leaders in the province.
