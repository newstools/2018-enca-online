He should have taken DA leadership into his confidence," said Bonginkosi Madikizela, Western Cape DA Leader. "Everything he said yesterday he disowned the DA. He said he hasn't joined the ANC yet but this shows his intention in future," said Madikizela.

It is the ANC election slogan. We note his appointment. Hopefully it will assist the province. But I think this is a political appointment in ANC minister's office. It is different from a department appointent. This is what is a concern for me," said Madikizela. Speaking to the media on Monday, Max said he was still a DA member and there's nothing wrong with his appointment. eNCA
