HOCKENHEIM, Germany – Daniel Ricciardo upstaged Lewis Hamilton to top the times for Red Bull in Friday’s opening free practice for this weekend’s German Grand Prix. The Australian, who is likely to start at the back of the grid after collecting grid penalties for three new power-unit parts, clocked a best lap in one minute and 13.525 to outpace the defending four-time champion’s Mercedes by just 0.004 seconds. Ricciardo’s Red Bull team-mate, Dutchman Max Verstappen, was third, nearly two-tenths off the pace, ahead of championship leader and local hero Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari and Finns Valtteri Bottas, in the second Mercedes, and Kimi Raikkonen, in the second Ferrari.

Ricciardo’s success meant Hamilton’s mini-run of being fastest in the previous three Friday opening sessions was ended. AFP
