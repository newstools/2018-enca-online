SAN DIEGO - Early arrivals at San Diego Comic-Con were treated to a preview night scream-fest Wednesday as New Line Cinema unleashed exclusive footage of its most hotly anticipated horror movies. The Warner Bros-owned studio kicked off the evening at a packed downtown theatre with an exclusive first look at "It: Chapter Two" and its terrifying antagonist, Pennywise.

The two-part feature adaptation of "It," Stephen King's 1986 novel, follows seven smalltown children who are terrorized by a killer clown.

"It: Chapter Two" is set 27 years after the first film, and the Losers Club have grown up and moved away -- but a devastating phone call brings them back together. The sneak peak gave the audience their first glimpse at the grown-up cast, which includes Bill Hader, Jessica Chastain and James McAvoy, in a reunion at a Chinese restaurant.

"It's going to be scarier, it's going to be more intense, so bring your adult diapers," he joked after the climactic jump scare provoked a cacophony of shrieks. The Comic-Con fan convention brings 130,000 visitors a year to San Diego, where they spend four days catching up on the latest movies and TV panels, collecting comics and dressing up as their favourite pop culture characters.
