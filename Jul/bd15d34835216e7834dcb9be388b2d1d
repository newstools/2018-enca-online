JOHANNESBURG – Chippa United have announced the signings of Thabo Matlaba, Thamsanqa Sangweni and Bernard Morrison from Orlando Pirates. The trio becomes the latest additions to the Chilli boys after the club announced earlier the capturing of a veteran defender and striker in Thabo Nthethe and Daine Klate. Matlaba headlines the signing after spending six years with the Sea Robbers. Ghanaian born Morrison could not make an impact at Pirates in two seasons while Sangweni’s spell with the Soweto giants became a similarity with that of downs as he could not break into the starting lineup. ***SIGNINGS ALERT***
		
		Chippa United Executive Chairman, Siviwe Mpengesi has confirmed the signing of Bernard Morrison, Thamsanqa Sangweni and Thabo Matlaba from Orlando Pirates. According to the club the trio has been brought to bolster the squad for the up-coming season. The three players have been brought in not only to fill the gaps left by the departure of Konqobe, Mdlinzo and Setelele earlier in the week, but to also bolster the squad and bring in more experienced players. “The trio will join the rest of the team on their last day of pre-season in Johannesburg tomorrow [Saturday], and will return to Nelson Mandela Bay on Wednesday for an afternoon training session,” the club's official Twitter page posted. eNCA
