JOHANNESBURG - Despite leading the South African conference the Lions have been far from convincing recently. Captain Warren Whiteley says they will step it up this Saturday when they take on the Bulls at Ellis Park.

The bulls are a different kettle of fish, they put you under pressure in different areas of the field and they play an exciting brand of rugby. They are going to test us, we are going to have to be alert,” added the Lions captain. #LIOvBUL
