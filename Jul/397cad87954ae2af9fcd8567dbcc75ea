WATCH: Gigaba comments on resignation of Home Affairs Director-General Gigaba has now appointed Nthumeni Nengovhela as the acting Deputy Director-General for Information Services. Outgoing Director-General Mkuseli Apleni has commenced the handing over process to Mavuso to ensure a smooth transition pending his departure.
