JOHANNESBURG – Some Zimbabweans do not trust the integrity of the country's Electoral Commission. “It should be an independent body it should operate on its own, but from the look of things there is total interference from the ruling party which is very wrong in terms of the law and that is the reason why we are protesting,” said Zimbabwe citizen, Justin Maradza. At the same time, the United Nations said it was concerned about increasing reports of voter intimidation.
