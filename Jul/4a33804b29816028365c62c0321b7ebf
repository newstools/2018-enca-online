READ: Another miner killed at Sibanye's Driefontein mine The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) said in a statement on Sunday night the high temperatures, which rose to 64 to 67 degrees Celsius underground, made rescue efforts almost impossible. "Breathing is difficult due to ventilation pipes being damaged by the flames, and communication lines have also been compromised," said the union. "Amcu sends heartfelt condolences to the loved ones and colleagues of the five fallen mineworkers.  The AMCU leadership is currently at the mine, praying that the situation will change for the good and that the remaining worker can be evacuated alive." eNCA
