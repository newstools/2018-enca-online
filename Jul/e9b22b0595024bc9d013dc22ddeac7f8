DURBAN - Police commissioner General Khehla Sitole condemned the "senseless killing" of people associated with the Ivory-Park and the Kempton Park taxi associations in Gauteng. A group of unidentified gunmen opened fire on a minibus taxi on the R74 between Colenso and Weenen on Saturday night. Preliminary reports indicate that the eleven were among 17 people that were travelling in a taxi coming from a funeral in the province. It is believed unknown men opened fire on the taxi, fatally wounding 11 people. Sitole activated a 72-hour action plan consisting of members from specialised units within the police - including Crime Intelligence, the Hawks, and the Special Task Force - to trace and apprehend those responsible for these killings. This is the latest in a series of attacks on taxis in South Africa. The country has seen a spate of taxi violence by rival groups vying for dominance on profitable routes. eNCA
