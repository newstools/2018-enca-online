PARIS - Chris Froome was cleared Monday of wrongdoing in his 'anti-doping' case which had cast a shadow over his participation in the Tour de France. "The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) confirms that the anti-doping proceedings involving Mr Christopher Froome have now been closed," cycling's ruling body announced.

		Ready to watch the btfl race with talented #Froome, what a story @Augustinbig ... sorry to @Hitclo, the Quintana & @Movistar_Team fan! pic.twitter.com/0NfQKTRNoy Team Sky's four-time Tour de France champion has been under a cloud since he was found to have twice the permissible amount of asthma drug Salbutamol in his system during September's Vuelta a Espana, which he won. "I am very pleased that the UCI has exonerated me," Froome said. Tour de France organisers on Sunday banned Froome from taking part to protect the integrity of the world's best-known cycling race. AFP
