BULAWAYO - Pakistan won the toss and decided to bat first in the fifth and final one-day international against Zimbabwe at Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo on Sunday. READ: Zimbabwe bat first in second one-dayer against Pakistan Pakistan has an unassailable 4-0 lead in the series, and such has been their dominance that Zimbabwe would do very well to avoid a whitewash. The visitors have passed 300 in both previous games where they batted first, amassing 399 for one in the last match. Pakistan has broken several records already during this series and there are two more that in-form opening batsman Fakhar Zaman will have in his sights. He needs 20 runs to break the record for fastest to 1,000 runs in ODI cricket, while 37 runs will give him the record for most runs in a five-match ODI series, a title currently held by Zimbabwe captain Hamilton Masakadza.

Left-arm spinner Mohammad Nawaz, left-arm pacer Mohammad Amir and right-arm quick Hasan Ali all return to the XI, Ali having recovered from the slight neck strain which kept him out of the last game. There were several changes for the beleaguered Zimbabweans. Both Blessing Muzarabani and Richard Ngarava picked up injuries on Friday, and so seamers Chris Mpofu and Tendai Chatara return to the attack. Batsman Prince Masvaure and offspinner Liam Roche also return, with Tarisai Musakanda and Tendai Chisoro sitting out. AFP
