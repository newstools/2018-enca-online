TSHIKAPA, DR Congo – Five people burned to death after a small passenger aircraft crashed on Friday in southern Democratic Republic of Congo near the border with Angola, a local official said, giving a provisional toll. The piston-engined Antonov 2, operated by local airline Air Kasai, burst into flames after crashing just after takeoff from Kamako for a flight to Tshikapa, 150 kilometres (93 miles) away. "The plane crashed into the brush three kilometres (two miles) from Kamako," said Anacletus Muswa Kapinga Safia, the deputy territorial administrator. "Only two people got out, the pilot and a passenger. They are unable to talk," he said. READ: DR Congo officially declares end to Ebola outbreak "We already know that five people have died.
