LONDON – Kevin Anderson needs to trust his own ability in order to beat Roger Federer in Wednesday's Wimbledon quarter-finals, his fellow South African tennis star Wayne Ferreira told AFP. Anderson, the big-serving US Open finalist who is seeded eighth, is the first South African to reach the Wimbledon quarter-finals since Ferreira himself in 1994. Former world number six Ferreira, 46, is one of the few players with a positive record against Federer, and reckons Anderson needs to summon his self-belief to down the defending Wimbledon champion. "The biggest problem is he needs to trust himself a bit more. He needs to believe that he can win and that's always the doubt that comes in when it gets closer, towards tie-breakers," the retired star said.

"Kevin never believed he could make a final of a Grand Slam like he did last year. Now that he does, it makes it easier for him." AFP
