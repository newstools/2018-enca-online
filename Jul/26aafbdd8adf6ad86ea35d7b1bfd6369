JOHANNESBURG - The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) says more than 90 percent of social grant beneficiaries have received their monthly payments. Last week Sassa faced a crisis of failed payments and technical glitches, leaving over 700,000 social-grant recipients desperate. Sassa has asked beneficiaries to be patient as the agency switches to the new card system.

However, that was done and in some instances, we know that these problems would crop up." Grant beneficiaries who have not received their money for July have told eNCA though that they can't take medication without eating first, yet have no money for food. Sassa, however, is adamant the system failures that affected this month's payments won't be repeated. eNCA
