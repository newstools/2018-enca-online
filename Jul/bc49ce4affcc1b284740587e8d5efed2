JOHANNESBURG - VBS customers were queuing to draw their money on Friday after the Reserve Bank struck a deal with Nedbank to pay the mutual bank' customers their cash. The bank was placed under curatorship earlier this year amid allegations of mismanagement and fraud. The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) subsequently made provisions for VBS customers to access up to R100,000 of their funds through Nedbank.
