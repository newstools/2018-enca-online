ESPELETTE, France - Britain's Geraint Thomas virtually secured his maiden Tour de France triumph after finishing third in the penultimate stage time trial in the Basque country on Saturday. "I don’t know what to say. It’s just overwhelming," said Thomas, who finished 14sec behind stage winner Tom Dumoulin of Sunweb on the last real test of the race before Sunday's final stage to Paris. "I didn’t think about winning the Tour de France for the whole race and suddenly... I've won the Tour, man! "I can’t speak. It’s just incredible." He took third place on the stage and even had time to celebrate as he crossed the line. What a moment for Geraint Thomas!

It’s wonderful!" Thomas, of Team Sky, held a 2min 05 sec overnight lead on Dutch rival Dumoulin (Sunweb) ahead of the 31km race against the clock from Saint-Pee-Sur-Nivelle to Espelette. READ: Thomas expects the 'worst', but fires warning to Tour rivals Dumoulin is the world time trial champion, and he stayed true to form by powering over the technical course in a time of 40min 50sec to leave Thomas 14sec in arrears. But it was only enough to secure his virtual runner-up place in the race, Dumoulin's second in a Grand Tour this year after he finished runner-up to Chris Froome at the Giro d'Italia in May, but his first on the Tour.
