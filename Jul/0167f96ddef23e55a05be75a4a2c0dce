JOHANNESBURG - The National Union of Mineworkers is rejecting Eskom revised 6.7 percent wage offer. NUM is sticking to its demand for a 9 percent increase. Negotiations between Eskom and unions are continuing in Woodmead. "I can confirm that Eskom has upped its offer... with the mandate that we have, it's below our fallback position. We will make a counter proposal," said William Mabapa, from NUM. eNCA
