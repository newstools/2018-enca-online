PARIS – Cameroonian President Paul Biya, 85, who announced Friday he would stand for a seventh term, is currently the second longest-serving African leader, with 35 years under his belt. Only his counterpart Teodoro Obiang Nguema of Equatorial Guinea is ahead of him, by three years. More than 30 years  Obiang, 76, has been the leader of the tiny, oil-rich Equatorial Guinea for nearly 39 years. He came to power in a coup on August 3, 1979. He was re-elected to a fifth seven-year term in 2016.  In Cameroon, Biya became president on November 6, 1982.  Congolese President Denis Sassou Nguesso has spent 34 years in office, but not in one go. He first served from 1979 to 1992 and then came back to run the country in 1997 at the end of a civil war. Sassou Nguesso was re-elected in March 2016 and could run again when his current term expires.
