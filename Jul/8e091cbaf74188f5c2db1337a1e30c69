JOHANNESBURG – Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) Minister Dr. Zweli Mkhize has issued an emotional tribute to the late University of Cape Town Professor Bongani Mayosi. Mayosi was a highly revered chief specialist, a brilliant academic, and researcher as well a world renowned cardiologist according to Mkhize. “He could have been recruited to a lucrative job, as a full-time top specialist earning millions of Rands in private health care institutions in this country,” Mkhize said in a statement. “Any international institution of his specialty would have been honoured had Prof Mayosi applied to be part of their specialist staff establishment… however [he] elected to serve the poor and ordinary underprivileged citizens who depend on the public health care service for their needs. He knew our people invested in all the knowledge he possessed and also deserved the best.” READ: Top South African cardiologist Professor Bongani Mayosi dies Mkhize’s statement went on to try to comfort the Mayosi family.
	
	“May it comfort the beloved family to know that we share in their grief. No words can heal a grieving heart of a wife and soul mate left abruptly or comfort children and relatives who have lost a father, brother, an uncle or role model.  We nevertheless wish the family to know that our thoughts and prayers are with them at this difficult time." Mkize concluded by saying: Farewell friend and colleague! Your achievements were a source of pride and inspiration to us all. You ran a good race and you fought a good fight."
