JOHANNESBURG - Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane said striker Gaston Sirino stole the show as his team beat Togolose champions AS Toga-Port over the weekend to move closer to a quarterfinal spot in the Caf Champions League. The Uruguayan had a hand in both goals, scoring the first and creating the second that was finished by Sibusiso Vilakazi. READ: Jeremy Brockie: Goals are coming “He must carry the team now,” Mosimane said on Monday. “It’s his chance. That’s why we brought him here. This is the performance I went to see in Bolivia. It’s good for him to give us confidence and hope.” The victory at the Lucas Moripe Stadium took them from the basement of Group C and within touching distance of the quarterfinals of the Champions League. But the Brazilians haven’t been at their best even though they beat the Togolese side and Kaizer Chiefs in the Shell Helix Ultra Cup last week. “We have the personnel to compete,” Mosimane said. “We just have to fit in a few guys in the way we play. We have to fit in Ali Meza and Toni Silva. Lyle Lakay came and fitted in nicely." "We don’t have many players because we don’t want to interfere too much with the squad because sometimes when you bring too many people you have to justify why you brought them and have to play them. We are only four weeks into our programme. We will get better. I am happy that we won last week and in the Champions League.” Sundowns’ win over AS Togo-Port will give the side confidence ahead of their trip to Morocco next month to take on Wydad Casablanca.
