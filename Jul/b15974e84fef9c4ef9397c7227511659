An HSM is a hardware that "runs on encryption software to "generate, protect, and manage encryption keys used to protect data in a secure, tamper-resistant module," it said. "Our society is increasingly dependent on data security solutions to secure all sorts of social, commercial or personal information," the EU's competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.

With the merger, Thales is aiming to become a global leader in digital security. The commission expressed concern that the merger would reduce players in the market. Gemalto is active in mobile platforms and services, mobile embedded software and products, smart cards, identification documents, government programmes, machine to machine communication, and enterprise security. The Commission said it has until 29 November to take a decision. AFP
