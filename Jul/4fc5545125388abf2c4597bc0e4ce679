JOHANNESBURG - No surprises are expected on Thursday afternoon when the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) makes it's latest interest rates announcement. The SARB is largely expected to keep interest rates on hold. The repo rate is currently at 6,5 percent, with the prime lending rate at banks at 10 percent. Statistics South Africa (Stats SA) inflation figures showed this week that inflation rose to 4,6 percent in June.

Inflation is expected to remain within the target range of 3 to 6 percent for the rest of the year. Many analysts expect the next move to be a rate hike in the middle of next year. eNCA
