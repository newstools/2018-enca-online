JOHANNESBURG - Ajax Cape Town withdrew its application to interdict the start of the 2018-19 Absa Premiership season on Thursday. The Premier Soccer Leauge (PSL) was granted leave to appeal the high court decision to set aside advocate William Mokhari's judgment against Ajax Cape Town. On July 2, South Gauteng High Court Judge Denise Fischer set aside Safa Arbitrator William Mokhari’s ruling to dock the Urban Warriors points for fielding former player Tendai Ndoro illegally. Following a meeting of the NSL’s Board of Governors, a decision was taken to appeal the ruling – that appeal was granted in the high court earlier on Thursday. The PSL confirmed that the start of the 2018-19 Absa Premiership season will commence as scheduled. eNCA
