JOHANNESBURG - Barclays Africa Group has been officially renamed and started trading as Absa Group Limited on Wednesday. The group says the name change marks the end of a century of Barclays on the continent. When the time came to re-imagine a new Absa, we looked to the people of Africa for inspiration. Itâ€™s through their creativity, ingenuity and audacity that they get things done. We call this #Africanacity.
