JOHANNESBURG - The Premier Soccer League Executive Committee on Thursday announced it will appeal the judgement handed down by Judge Denise Fisher on the Ajax Cape Town matter. Monday's Johannesburg high court ruling by judge Fisher to overrule the earlier decision by advocate Mokhari to dock Ajax the seven points from the games in which the allegedly ineligible Tendai Ndoro played, saw the Cape side reinstated to 15th place on the league standings.

But while Fischer set aside the Mokhari's verdict, she did not offer a solution for the way forward and instead referred the Ndoro matter back to the FIFA Playersâ€™ Status Committee to make a final ruling on the issue.

The PSL said full particulars will be provided after the extraordinary meeting of the National Soccer League Board of Governors. African News Agency
