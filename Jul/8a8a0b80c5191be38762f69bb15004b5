JOHANNESBURG – The South African Football Association (Safa) says they have not received an offer for the services of Bafana Bafana coach Stuart Baxter from Kaizer Chiefs. Baxter has been linked with a return to Chiefs but Safa said he’s part of their plans until 2022. As the start of the new Absa Premiership season draws closer Chiefs remain without a coach since Steve Komphela resigned. Safa CEO, Dennis Mumble said:“There’s nothing in front of us that says this way or that way we still have a coach he has been signed for the long haul and we are going to continue to look at him preparing our national teams going forward. So it’s not a scenario that we contemplate but until something is put in front of us but we expect that contract will be respected and the contract is until after the World Cup is 2022.” eNCA
