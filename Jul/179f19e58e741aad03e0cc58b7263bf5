SAMARA, Russia - Neymar said Brazil need to "learn to suffer" after their 2-0 win over Mexico on Monday booked a World Cup quarter-final place. The five-time champions overcame a tricky start to the last-16 tie, as second-half goals from Neymar and Roberto Firmino sealed a deserved victory and a last-eight clash with either Belgium or Japan. "We have to learn to suffer," said Neymar. "It was a very difficult match, we knew the quality of our opponents." #BRA get the job done! --
		
		Second-half goals from @neymarjr and Roberto Firmino mean that @CBF_Futebol are through to the quarter-finals! #BRAMEX pic.twitter.com/LHBtM2Ajbw The Paris Saint-Germain forward stabbed home a low cross from Willian in the 51st minute to score his sixth World Cup goal and second of this year's tournament, but first in a knockout match. "Neymar was out for three-and-a-half months. At the top level, this is a lot," said Brazil coach Tite. "A top-notch athlete would need four or five matches to recover properly. In the previous match he was excellent and here he repeated a high-quality performance." Chelsea winger Willian was a constant threat to the Mexican defence with his driving runs, as he continues to improve after a disappointing display in the opening 1-1 draw with Switzerland. The best part of Neymar’s goal isn’t the dribbling, the flick, or even the finish. It’s his movement after the flick to Willian that finds the pocket of space.

Brazil are bidding for a record-extending sixth World Cup trophy after their semi-final humiliation four years ago against Germany on home soil, but would face a tough test against a talented Belgium outfit should the Red Devils get past Japan.
