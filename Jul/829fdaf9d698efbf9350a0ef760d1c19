JOHANNESBURG - Newly elected Gauteng ANC chairperson David Makhura says the province is forging ahead with plans to release state-owned land. Makhura, who is also the premier of Gauteng, says this will happen with or without proposed changes to the Constitution. In May, the Gauteng government appointed a team to develop a plan for rapid land release. The team must identify plots owned by local, provincial and national government, to allocate to those who would rather build their own homes than wait for houses to be built.

Without compensation.” eNCA
