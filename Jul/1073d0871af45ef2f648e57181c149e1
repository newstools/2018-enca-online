		Now this is a story, all about how
		My life got flipped, turned upside-down
		And I'd like to take a minute
		Just sit right there
		I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air Will Smith doing Will Smith things while being the Willest of Smiths..#WorldCup Show de Will Smith na final da Copa do Mundo pic.twitter.com/iA1QmJ97i2 As Smith performed at Moscow's Luzhniki stadium, giant screens laid out on the pitch showed images of soccer players and the colours of the Croatian and French flags - the two teams who face each other in the final. Smith was joined on stage by Nicky Jam, a US-born singer with Puerto Rican roots, and by Era Istrefi, a pop singer who describes herself as Albanian Kosovar. Both artists had featured with Smith on the "Live It Up" single. The performances were a prelude to France and Croatia's players taking to the pitch to begin their final match, in front of a packed crowd at the 80,000-seat stadium.
