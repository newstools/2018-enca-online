No arrest has been made but police are on the trail of the abductors, he said. Obi senior has been kidnapped once before, in the central city of Jos in 2011. Kidnapping of prominent and rich people and their families is common in southern Nigeria. The victims are usually released unhurt after a ransom is paid. AFP
