JOHANNESBURG - The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) says South Africa is unlikely to dip into a recession but warns that slow economic growth will not bring down the high unemployment rate. Speaking at the Reserve Bank's AGM, Governor Lesetja Kganyago also warned that nationalising the bank could be a lengthy and expensive legal process. Kganyago says business and consumer confidence surrounding Cyril Ramaphosa's election as president in February has not translated into a short-term boost for actual economic growth. In the first quarter of the year, the economy contracted by 2,2 percent, after its somewhat surprising 3,1 percent growth in the last quarter of 2017. The governor says a second successive quarter of negative growth is highly unlikely.

However, the SARB says at these levels the government can't expect to make meaningful inroads in lowering the stubbornly high unemployment rate. The governor also addressed the bank's mandate, in the wake of calls for it to be nationalised. “A group of shareholders is agitating for the SARB’s nationalisation, as they believe that they are entitled to a share of the assets of the SARB and see this as an opportunity to make enormous profits at the expense of taxpayers,” said Kganyago. The bank’s mandate is to ensure price stability, and it has an inflation-target range of 3 to 6 percent. Some opponents say its mandate should be changed to promoting employment rather than fighting inflation. eNCA
