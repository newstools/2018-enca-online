JOHANNESBURG – The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) says it's ready for its 5th-anniversary celebrations. The party will hold its celebrations at the Sisa Dukashe Stadium in Mdantsane, Eastern Cape on Saturday. The EFF said it was expecting thousands of South Africans to join the celebrations. Meanwhile, the party said it's not expecting prominent business leaders but the working class at its anniversary. This is according to party spokesperson Mbuyiseli Ndlozi. He said business people in South Africa are still not comfortable spending their money on the EFF. #EFFTurns5 Ndlozi says they are not expecting any prominent business leaders at their fifth anniversary. pic.twitter.com/YcJstgqyX4 — Samkele Maseko (@samkelemaseko) July 27, 2018  “Business people in Buffalo city that is a straight no, I am trying to think of a prominent business person we might have in mind, certainly Patrice Motsepe won’t be here because we want to take his mines, the Ruperts because we want to take the land,” Ndlozi said.
