JOHANNESBURG – Another taxi boss was murdered on Monday, this time in Gauteng. In Alexandra, Johannesburg, a taxi owner was gunned down in broad daylight. Nothing was taken from him, and police say the motive for the killing is still unclear. This comes two days after another deadly shooting in KwaZulu Natal where 11 people were killed and 4 more hospitalised. The Ivory Park Taxi Association says they are confused about the murder of their members in the province. Two escaped unharmed when their combi came under fire. The men were returning to Gauteng from a funeral of their colleague. The vehicle had 17 occupants in the taxi and over 250 bullets were fired. The association says the attack has left them angry and confused.

The South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) also wants answers. It says there should be an arrest soon, and the associations’ operating permit should be stripped. “We need to eradicate those some that are doing it," Phillip Taaibosc, chairperson of Santaco said. eNCA
