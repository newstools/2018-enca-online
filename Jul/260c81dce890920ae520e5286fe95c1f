JOHANNESBURG – The Crusaders and Lions should make light work of their Super Rugby semifinals if history is anything to go by as four become two on Saturday. The Lions will be looking to take their semi-final record to 3 from 3 on Saturday when the Waratahs, who shocked the Highlanders with a comeback, arrive at Emirates Airline Park for a 15:05 kick-off. And history favours the South Africans with over 80% of home sides winning at this stage of the competition. It was the Highlanders, back in 2015 and coincidentally over the Waratahs, that hold the record for the last away side to advance to the main fixture of rugby’s most adrenaline-sapping event. The history books are equally kind to the Crusaders, who face the Hurricanes for the fourth time at this stage with three wins to their name heading into Saturday. Derbies have been unkind to the travelling sides with the Hurricanes class of 2018 looking to become just the third team from 17 encounters to upset the trend of a home side win. As if the home sides were not favourites already, the margin of victory tends to hit double digits with 35 of the last 44 semi-finals being decided by 10 or more points.
