The broad-based S&P 500 dipped 0.1 percent to 2,816.13, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 0.5 percent to 7,699.67. Investors are keen to see quarterly results from Apple coming late Tuesday following mixed earnings thus far from tech giants. Some investors fear a deeper selloff in the high-flying technology sector following disappointing results from Facebook, Netflix and some other companies. Strength in tech stocks has also been an underlying support to the broader stock market. Other highlights this week include the July jobs report and a two-day Fed meeting that will update the market on the prospects for additional interest rate hikes in 2018.
