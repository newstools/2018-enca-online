MOSCOW – France beat Croatia 4-2 to land their second World Cup title two decades on from their famous victory against Brazil on home soil. An own-goal by Mario Mandzukic followed by goals by Antoine Griezmann, Paul Pogba, and teenager Kylian Mbappe were enough to secure the Les Blues another World crown in Moscow. France went into the match as clear favourites to triumph and was fuelled by the bitter disappointment of losing the Euro 2016 final to Portugal in Paris. Croatia had brought joy to their Balkan nation of just four million people by defying the odds to progress to the final while reigning champions Germany, then Argentina and Brazil all fell by the wayside in Russia.
