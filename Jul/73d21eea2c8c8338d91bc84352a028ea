HOUSTON, USA  – South Africa's top soccer players continue to make an impression in the competitive National Women's Soccer League in the United States. With several Banyana Banyana players like captain Janine van Wyk and Linda Mothlalo already doing well in the US, comes the news that latest recruit Thembi Kgatlana has made an ideal start to her career with the Houston Dash. The midfielder on Wednesday scored her first goal as Houston beat Orlando Pride 3-1. It was a satisfying moment for Kgatlana who had come on a substitute in the 71st minute. Houston were 1-0 up at halftime after a goal from Kealia Ohai in the 17th minute. Ohai scored her second goal just after the break before Kgatlana struck in stoppage time. African News Agency
