CAPE TOWN - A Somali man who was shot dead after fatally stabbing two worshippers and wounding two others at a mosque in Malmesbury suffered from schizophrenia, police said Thursday. Police ruled out any extremist motive behind the attack, saying that the suspect, Nur ArawalÂ (23) was recently been released from a psychiatric hospital in Cape Town. "The man had schizophrenia, we could not link him to any extremist or radical activity," Hangwani Mulaudzi, spokesman for the Hawks police investigation unit, told AFP. Arawal was shot dead by police at the mosque in Malmesbury, north of Cape Town, after entering the building carrying a knife and attacking worshippers. He tried to charge police before being killed.
