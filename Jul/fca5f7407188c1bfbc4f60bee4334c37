BRIDGETOWN - Banned Australian batsman Steve Smith will link up with Barbados Tridents for the Caribbean Premier League 2018. Smith replaces the Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan, who is no longer available for selection. Robin Singh, the Barbados coach, is ecstatic that someone of the stature of Smith is available to soften Shakib’s loss. READ: Aussie skipper Smith banned, Bancroft fined for ball-tampering “It is a huge blow to lose Shakib for the tournament but in Steve Smith, we have a truly world-class replacement who can help to bring power to our batting line-up,” said Singh, the former India all-rounder. “As a man who has played cricket at the highest level all over the world, we are very confident that Smith will be a big success with the Tridents.” This will be the latest step in Smith’s return to cricket, since being suspended by Cricket Australia (CA) from its national and domestic tournaments for his role in the ball-tampering scandal in Cape Town in March.
