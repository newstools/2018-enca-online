JOHANNESBURG - Investigative journalism team Amabhungane released a damning report on business mogul Christo Wiese’s alleged tax dodging on Thursday. The businessman has hit right back and, speaking to eNCA's Jeremy Maggs, also opened up about the ongoing Steinhoff saga. In the Amabhungane report, they illustrate how Wiese got caught up in a legal battle in the Western Cape High Court between the SA Revenue Service (Sars) and top law firm, ENSafrica. Wiese has been implicated in what Sars is describing as an elaborate tax-dodging scheme, and now the taxman wants R3,0-billion in back taxes and penalties.

It seems the revenue collector drew a target on Wiese’s back around 2009 when British officials seized suitcases of cash he was trying to fly to Luxembourg. In 2012, City Press and The Sunday Times reported that Wiese allegedly owed Sars R2-billion. Amabhungane says the SARS letters used in their report arrived literally within a month of those articles. AmaBhungane journalist Craig McKune explains this further in the video below. eNCA
