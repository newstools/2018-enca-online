The Ryan's World merchandise will be sold exclusively at more than 2,500 Walmart stores in the United States and on the Walmart.com website starting Aug. 6. The products will expand to other retailers in October. Ryan's six YouTube channels have enthralled children, often drawing more than 1 billion views a month to videos of him playing with toys and reacting to them. His family has kept his last name secret given his young age. Pocket.watch has negotiated licensing deals for a handful of online video stars to expand their reach through toys, apparel and home products. The Ryan's World merchandise, designed for ages 3 and up, is the first to come to market. The products include T-shirts with four designs featuring some of Ryan's favourite things, including pizza.
