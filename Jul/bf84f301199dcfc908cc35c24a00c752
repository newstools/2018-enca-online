HOCKENHEIM - Lewis Hamilton went from 14th to first to take a "miracle" German Grand Prix victory for Mercedes on Sunday and retake the Formula One championship lead from Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, who crashed. Vettel, now 17 points behind the Briton after starting eight ahead, led from pole position until rain caused chaos in the closing laps, with the German skidding into the barriers in front of his home fans. HAMILTON: "It's very difficult from that position but you always have to believe. I kept pushing, kept believing and it happened" #GermanGP ---- #F1 pic.twitter.com/fwS8j42buh Reigning world champion Hamilton took the chequered flag, for a record-equalling fourth German Grand Prix win, ahead of his Finnish team mate Valtteri Bottas and Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen.
