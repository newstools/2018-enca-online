JOHANNESBURG – Orlando Pirates assistant coach Rhulani Mokwena believes Belgium’s technical astute will be handy against France as the European neighbours prepare for Tuesday’s crunch time World Cup Semi-final fixture. It is down to the final four in the 2018 Russia World cup and Tuesday winners will take on either England or Croatia in Sunday’s final. “Belgium has been more enterprising they have played some more dominant and convincing football with emphasis on their build-ups and their positional play,” Mokwena said. “There’s a lot more forward passes and a lot more penetration in their position… these ones are using position to go forward to break lines.” Mokwena is adamant Belgium will win the tournament. "Football is about creating goals and play more for verticality and that’s what I feel maybe England are slightly behind them the same position orientated football but the difference is just a bit more verticality and a little bit more final third entries in their position than all the other teams France included." eNCA
