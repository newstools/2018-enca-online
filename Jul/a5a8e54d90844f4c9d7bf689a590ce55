NAIROBI - The presidents of Somalia and Eritrea on Monday signed an agreement to establish diplomatic ties after over a decade of animosity, in the latest fast-track rapprochement in the Horn of Africa. READ: UN commends Somali government's efforts "The two countries will establish diplomatic relations and exchange ambassadors," said a "joint declaration on brotherly relations" signed in Asmara by Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki and Somali counterpart Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed. Mohamed's three-day visit to Asmara coincides with an extraordinary peace process between Eritrea and Ethiopia - part of a dizzying change in a region burdened by war, proxy conflicts, isolation and iron-fisted rule. Once close, Somalia and Eritrea fell out over a decade ago as Asmara stood accused of backing Islamist militants on Somali soil in a proxy war with Ethiopia. Eritrea long denied this but was slapped with UN sanctions over its alleged backing of al-Shabaab in 2009.

The document, posted on Eritrea's information ministry website, also said the two nations "will endeavour to forge intimate political, economic, social, cultural as well as defense and security cooperation." They will in addition "work in unison to foster regional peace, stability and economic integration." AFP
