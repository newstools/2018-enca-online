JOHANNESBURG - MTN workers could go on strike due to a breakdown in salary negotiations. The Communication Workers Union (CWU) demonstrated outside MTN headquarters in Roodepoort on Friday. A memorandum was handed to the cellphone company, which has yet to respond. The union said it’s been having engagements and countless negotiations that have reached a deadlock. These were about salaries as well as other worker benefits.

The increases that they’ve given to workers are based on favouritism and not on principle. We are still calling for over 10% salary increases, we are still calling on housing allowance of R2500, a paid extended sick leave and all other demands that we have,” said Aubrey Tshabalala, CWU general secretary. Despite increased private security as well as police officers stationed outside the company’s entrance, the union says it will not or back down until its demands are heard and met. “We are basically going to give them four days failure to do so, obviously, we will embark on a serious action with regards to industrial action. This we can call a first warning shot," said Tshabalala. Members of the MTN negotiating body accepted the memorandum and promised to respond to the union after its reviewed their document. eNCA
