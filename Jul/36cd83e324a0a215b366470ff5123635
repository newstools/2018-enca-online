CARNOUSTIE, Scotland – It was the weather for ducks, not Tigers, but the 14-time major champion will be back at Carnoustie this weekend. Tiger Woods is a three-time Champion Golfer, so going through to play another 36 holes shouldn’t really be considered worthy of a headline. But the 42-year old is still early in his fledgeling comeback and had missed the cut in four of his previous five major starts, including last month’s US Open at Shinnecock Hills. His round had the perfect symmetry of four birdies and four bogeys but he will look back on several missed opportunities with regret. He hit 73 percent of his fairways and 72 percent of his greens in regulation but the putting stats, his recent problem, were not so good. Woods needed 32 to get around Carnoustie - despite the greens lacking the pace of Thursday after consistent rain. And he will really regret a missed birdie chance at the last, especially after hitting one of the best approaches of the day into the 18th green. “I could have cleaned up the round, I didn’t get off to the best start but I got it back,” he said. “It was the same score but this wasn’t as good as the first round, though I did get a birdie at the par five. I’m six back and I think by the end of the day I’ll be more than that. “It’s a pretty packed leaderboard but I’m certainly right there in it.” A moving army of colourful umbrellas accompanied Woods around the course, his popularity such that even rain wouldn’t stop his fans from marching to his beat. “I’ve won twice at St Andrews and always played well in Scotland, it’s fantastic to have the support I’ve had,” he added. “I’ve not played The Open for three years and I’ve loved the experience of being back. It was great to have that many people supporting in the rain and cheering us on. It was very appreciated.” African News Agency
