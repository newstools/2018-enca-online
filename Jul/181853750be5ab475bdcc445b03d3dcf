JOHANNESBURG - Former SARS commissioner Tom Moyane has failed in his attempt to have the SARS Inquiry stopped for now. Judge Nugent says the submission by Mpofu to have this commission stopped because Moyane has another hearing holds no merit as this inquiry is #Sars and not solely based on Moyane. #eNCA #SarsInquiry Judge Robert Nugent has refuted claims that Moyane was not invited. Judge Nugent says the submission on why Moyane was not invited is disingenuous and Moyane was at home watching TV when invited from 20 June already. #eNCA #SarsInquiry He also says the inquiry can't legally dissolve itself. Judge Nugent says this commission has no powers to decide on whether Sars should pay of Moyane’s Legal fees. #eNCA #SarsInquiry Last week former  SARS staff gave detailed testimonies about how they worked under a climate of intimidation and secrecy once Moyane took over the reins from Pravin Gordhan. Judge Nugent says the inquiry into #Sars is much broader but Moyane’s hearing is narrow and speaks to Moyane’s work. #eNCA #SarsInquiry Moyane made an 11-th hour appearance at the inquiry claiming the hearing was unfair and biased. eNCA
