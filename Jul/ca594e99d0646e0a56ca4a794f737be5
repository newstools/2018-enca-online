JOHANNESBURG - AfriForum will privately prosecute National Council of Provinces (NCOP) chairperson Thandi Modise on charges of animal cruelty at her farm. The lobby group says there's prima facie evidence to prosecute Modise successfully. Dozens of animals were found dead at her farm in North West in 2014. READ: Scores of dead animals found on Thandi Modise's farm It transpired the animals, including pigs, chickens, and goats, had been without water and food for a long time.
