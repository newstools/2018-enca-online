Third was Theuns van der Bank in 2:44:12. In the women’s race, Anriette Schoeman, who came third last year, was first over the line in 2:59:56 beating Candice Lill by two seconds and Lucy James by three seconds. “The guys were riding really aggressively, and it was a high pace the whole way,” said Schoeman. “Candice rode such a classy race! Hats off to Lucy James as well – she put on a brave fight. We were fighting it out for Queen of the Mountain and, seriously, ride of the day goes to Candice because she was just amazing after a brutal MTB race yesterday. I was lucky to take the win today; I think she had tired legs.” African News Agency
