JOHANNESBURG - This week marks one year since former African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) secretary general Sindiso Magaqa was shot. Magaqa was a key witness in the Hawks' investigation into political killings in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). WATCH: Sindiso Magaqa laid to rest Magaqa and two other councilors were shot shortly after the murder of three other people in the Umzimkhulu area. He died in hospital almost two months later. It was later suspected he was poisoned, but the Hawks denied this claim. Today all i think about is my brother and Comrade Sindiso Magaqa. Rest in Peace Shemeni. I love you. A Year Later, still no justice for #SindisoMagaqa This time tomorrow will be a year since you stopped your car at a local shop in Ibisi, & gunmen walked2ur car &sprayed bullets at u.
