JOHANNESBURG - The cold front that brought snow to the high ground of the Cape, heavy rain in the mountainous regions of the Western Cape, and freezing conditions to the rest of South Africa this morning, has now moved off into the Indian Ocean. IN PICTURES: Cold front brings snow to some parts of SA Even though the front is gone, the eNCA Weather centre is not expecting temperatures to bounce back very quickly. A high-pressure system has settled in over Eastern SA and will continue to bring a cooler easterly airflow to the eastern parts throughout this week. This will cause cloudy to partly cloudy weather over parts of Mpumalanga and Limpopo with light rain possible against the escarpment. A brief reminder to care for the most vulnerable... 2 and 4 legged among us in this cold!!

The community is now trying to rebuild. #ColdFront pic.twitter.com/GS4t3XHdjU The opposite is true for the Western coastal areas where an offshore airflow will result in significantly higher temperatures towards the weekend when Capetonians can look forward to sunny and warm conditions. WATCH: Wet, wet, wet weather in Cape Town Under calm and cloud-free skies, night-time temperatures will continue to drop below zero degrees over much of the interior with widespread frost expected in the mornings. eNCA
