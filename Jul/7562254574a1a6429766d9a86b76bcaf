JOHANNESBURG - The cold front that brought snow to the high ground of the Cape, heavy rain in the mountainous regions of the Western Cape, and freezing conditions to the rest of South Africa this morning, has now moved off into the Indian Ocean. IN PICTURES: Cold front brings snow to some parts of SA Even though the front is gone, the eNCA Weather centre is not expecting temperatures to bounce back very quickly. A high-pressure system has settled in over Eastern SA and will continue to bring a cooler easterly airflow to the eastern parts throughout this week. This will cause cloudy to partly cloudy weather over parts of Mpumalanga and Limpopo with light rain possible against the escarpment. Daytime temperatures in Johannesburg will remain below 20ºC until at least Sunday. #ShackFires In Alexandra residents whose homes burnt down are trying to salvage anything they can. #ColdFront pic.twitter.com/bqioztpg0H The opposite is true for the Western coastal areas where an offshore airflow will result in significantly higher temperatures towards the weekend when Capetonians can look forward to sunny and warm conditions.
