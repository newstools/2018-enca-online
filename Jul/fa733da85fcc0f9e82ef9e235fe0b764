JOHANNESBURG – Respected anchor Siki Mgabadeli is leaving the channel after four years at the helm of Moneyline. Her nightly show has kept viewers up to date on business news, tapping into economic talking points and market movements.
	
	During her time with eNCA she has travelled to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, bringing global business leaders into our frame. Siki has also brought her strong political news skills to the fore, anchoring key news events, most recently the ANC elective conference in December and the appointment of President Cyril Ramaphosa in February. Today marks my final broadcast on eNCA. It’s been an incredible 4 years. I am especially proud of the 485 episodes of #eNCAMoneyline and my superstar team. We did things I had only dreamt of doing. Thank you my people. And thank YOU for watching. Currently co-anchoring News Hour at 10 pm, Siki has now decided to start a new chapter in her life. “Today marks my final broadcast on eNCA. It’s been an incredible four years. I am especially proud of the 485 episodes of Moneyline and my superstar team. We did things I had only dreamt of doing. Thank you to these great journalists and producers. And thank YOU for watching,” says Siki.
	
	eNCA Editor-In-Chief Mapi Mhlanga says the channel is sad to see her go but wishes her all the best, “We thank Siki for her contribution to the channel. She helped build a solid economic platform on eNCA and her accomplished and authoritative approach made her a nightly news favourite.”
