He was served Tuesday with a new arrest warrant for first-degree murder, the Broward County Sheriff's office said. He is the second person arrested over the June 18 killing, with 22-year-old Dedrick Williams detained two days after XXXTentacion's death. The sheriff's department said it was still searching for another suspect, Robert Allen, who is also 22.

The 20-year-old rapper's star had quickly risen with his intensely personal, often suicidal verse and muffled musical delivery. His song "Sad!" soared to number one on the US chart after his death.
