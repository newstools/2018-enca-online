CAIRO - At least 58 people were injured on Friday when a passenger train derailed south ofÂ Egypt's capital Cairo, the health ministry said in a statement. "Most of the injuries are minor," Ahmed Mohei, an assistant to the health minister, told state television. Three carriages on a train headed to the southern province of Qena went off-track, state news agency MENA said, citing a transport ministry statement. Public Prosecutor Nabil Sadek ordered an investigation into the accident by a technical team from the Armed Forces Engineering Authority. The prosecutor also summoned a number of railway officials for questioning. Egyptians have long complained that governments have failed to enforce safety on the antiquated rail network. Reuters
