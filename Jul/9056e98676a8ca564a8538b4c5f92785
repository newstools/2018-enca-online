PRETORIA - The Minister of Police, Bheki Cele was among those who came out to march against gender-based violence on Tuesday. Cele says the #100MenMarch should be a daily event and that men need to be taught they need to change in order for women to be safe. In his address to the marchers, Cele urged women to walk away from abusive relationships. The build-up to the march was marred by controversy over the involvement of musician Arthur Mofokate who is currently on trial for assaulting singer Busisiwe Thwala, also known as Cici. Members of the #NotInMyName movement threatened to boycott the event if government did not distance itself from Mofokate's involvement. Government said it never invited Mafokate and can't prevent anyone from attending.
