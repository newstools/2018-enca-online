Police are still combing the area outside the food court at Pavilion shopping centre. No official confirmation from police yet, but sources say a suspicious device was apparently spotted.

Police are leaving the Pavilion mall. An officer on scene says it was a security tag normally used on appliances that caused suspicion. Public has been allowed back into the parking lot. #DBNexplosives pic.twitter.com/KJ5qxiCNpW On Saturday evening explosive devices were found before they exploded near the Greyville Racecourse, where the Durban July was taking place. Five explosive devices planted around Durban in the space of three days. There’ve been no arrests and police are not saying much about the investigation. Tiso Blackstar’s @wicks_jeff and I chatted about it a little while ago on #eNCA. pic.twitter.com/EcuooAIO3Q Devices had previously been found at Woolworths stores. eNCA
