LONDON - Europe's main stock markets stuttered on Tuesday as dealers balanced eurozone data showing both an economic slowdown and accelerating inflation, dealers said. READ: European motor stocks rise in respond to tariff relief Frankfurt and Paris stocks wobbled but London rose on strong second-quarter BP results -- and despite growing expectation that the Bank of England could raise British interest rates this Thursday to the highest level for more than nine years. Economic growth in the 19-nation eurozone slowed in the second quarter this year, data showed, amid rising concerns over the impact of global trade tensions fuelled by Washington. Gross domestic product (GDP) expansion in the single currency bloc hit 0.3 percent in the three months to June, below the 0.4 percent of the previous quarter. Eurozone inflation meanwhile accelerated in July to 2.1 percent on high oil prices. That was the fastest rate since late 2012 and pushed the euro higher versus the dollar. Inflation tempers GDP impact "A disappointing eurozone GDP reading was countered by a better-than-forecast inflation figure, flattening out the potential reaction to either number," noted Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell. "The euro-damaging nature of that (GDP) number was tempered by the news that inflation hit 2.1 percent in July, the metric crossing the European Central Bank's long-held 2.0-percent target for the first time since 2012." Uncertainty over trade helped ECB governors last week decide to leave interest rates at historic lows even though they stuck to plans to halve "quantitative easing" or mass bond-buying from October before wrapping up the stimulus at the end of 2018.

"Ultimately, stocks could come under pressure as the latest eurozone data suggests that the ECB is in a bind -- weaker GDP, yet inflation is rising at its fastest rate since December 2012," Brooks told AFP. "Considering the ECB has an inflation mandate only, this could indicate that rates may have to rise just at the time that growth is starting to slow. This is good news for the euro, bad news for stocks." BoJ tweaks policy Asian equities traded mixed as the Bank of Japan tweaked its monetary policy in a bid to make its massive easing programme sustainable. Tokyo's key Nikkei index closed marginally higher after the BoJ announced it had revised down inflation forecasts while making minor changes to its ultra-loose monetary policy for the first time in nearly two years. US tech equities had tumbled Monday, pushing the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index in New York down 1.4 percent. The slump affecting the sector's biggest five stocks -- Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google -- has injected trepidation into world markets ahead of an Apple earnings announcement later Tuesday, analysts said. Silicon Valley shares have been in retreat since Facebook last week signalled slower growth as it spends more on data security in response to criticism over its privacy policies. Back in London, a growing number of economists forecast that the Bank of England could lift its key interest rate by a quarter-point to 0.75 percent on Thursday, as it seeks to tackle stubbornly above-target UK inflation.
