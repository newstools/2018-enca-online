Scores of ANC members came in their numbers to witness the launch of the president’s Thuma Mina campaign in the province. The party’s hoping the initiative will help bring unity to a deeply divided ANC particularly in KwaZulu-Natal. It’s also aimed at reviving party membership ahead of the 2019 elections. “We must also keep in mind comrades that when we’re not united, when we disunited, when we fight amongst ourselves our 12-million supporters they looked at us and they start walking away from you,” said President Cyril Ramaphosa.
