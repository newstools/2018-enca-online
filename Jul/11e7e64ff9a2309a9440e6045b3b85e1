JOHANNESBURG - The main event of EFC 72, which takes place on the 11th of August in Cape Town, is one of those rare bouts which feature two evenly-matched and highly-respected NBK's of such outstanding ability and balls-to-the-wall attitude that it's almost impossible to call a result. However, our pro-picks gave it their best shot when they broke down the cataclysmic clash that is Martin 'The Punisher' Van Staden (26-10) versus Dave 'The Pain Train' Mazany (16-6).
