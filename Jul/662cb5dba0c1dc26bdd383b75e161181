JOHANNESBURG - Novak Djokovic powered to his fourth Wimbledon title with a 6-2, 6-2, 7-6 (7/3) rout of South Africa's Kevin Anderson in Sunday's final. Djokovic is a Grand Slam champion for the first time since winning the 2016 French Open. It is the 31-year-old Serb's first Wimbledon crown since 2015, making the world number 21 the lowest ranked man to win at the All England Club since Goran Ivanisevic in 2001. Djokovic's 13th Grand Slam title puts him fourth on the all-time list of male major winners, with Roger Federer leading the way on 20. Tennis fans’ eyes were glued to the screen as Anderson took on the Serb. It was the first time in nearly a century that a South African’s made it to the end of the competition, and no South African has ever won the tournament. Anderson’s had a grueling time getting there. Sunday was his third consecutive match against a top-12 player after he beat Roger Federer and John Isner.
