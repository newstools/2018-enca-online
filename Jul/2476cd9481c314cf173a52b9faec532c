TOKYO - The EU and Japan signed a sweeping free trade deal on Tuesday that officials called a "clear message" against protectionism, as Washington imposes controversial tariffs and threatens a trade war.

"We are sending a clear message that we stand together against protectionism," EU Council President Donald Tusk said. "Together we are making -- by signing this agreement -- a statement about free and fair trade, we are showing that we are stronger and better off when we work together," added Commission head, Jean-Claude Juncker. The huge deal was signed as President Donald Trump unsettles allies and provokes rivals with his aggressive "America First" trade policy. Both the EU and Japan have been hit with new US tariffs despite their longstanding alliances with Washington.

"There is no protection in protectionism," he said. Abe, standing alongside the two EU officials, said the agreement, "shows the world the unshaken political will of Japan and the EU to lead the world as the champions of free trade at a time when protectionism has spread".
