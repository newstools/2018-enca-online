PARIS - Six sovereign wealth funds including four Gulf states have pledged to boost efforts to fight climate change at a Paris meeting called by Emmanuel Macron, the French presidential office announced on Friday. The state funds of Kuwait, Norway, New Zealand, Qatar, Saudi Arabia,Â  and the United Arab Emirates -- global finance heavyweights mainly fuelled by domestic oil and gas revenue -- promised to encourage the companies they invest in to tackle the rising threat of a warming planet.

In it they agree to push firms to integrate the risk of climate change into their business plans and publish information on strategies to reduce carbon use. "The transition to a low-carbon economy creates new investment opportunities," the six funds said in the charter, adding that long-term investments could help finance the shift to greener energy sources.
