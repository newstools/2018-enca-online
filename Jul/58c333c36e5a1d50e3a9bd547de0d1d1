JOHANNESBURG - The South African Reserve Bank (SARB)'s revealed a bleak outlook for the country's economic growth this year, downgrading its forecast. Governor Lesetja Kganyago announced interest rates remain unchanged on Thursday. According to Kganyago: "The domestic economic growth outlook for this year is weaker than we had expected in May. Following the broad-based contraction of 2.2% in the first quarter and early indications of modest growth in the second quarter, the SARB’s forecast now indicates a growth rate of 1.2% for 2018 compared with 1.7% previously. The forecast for 2019 is 1.9%, marginally higher than the previous forecast of 1.7%, while the forecast for 2020 is unchanged at 2.0%. At these growth rates, the negative output gap is wider in the near term but is still expected to close in 2020."
