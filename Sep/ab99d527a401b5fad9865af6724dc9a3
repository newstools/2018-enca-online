   JOHANNESBURG - KwaZulu-Natal Correctional Services authorities have dismissed claims of inhumane conditions at the country’s only super-maximum prison in Ebongweni, Kokstad. Some inmates have complained of harsh conditions at the centre. Correctional Services denies the claims. “There is nothing hidden, what is done there, people are getting treated well as human beings like in all other facilities. It is a special facility of course because people are housed individually, they get to go to exercise, they get to go through the programmes, we’ve got phycologists, we’ve got social workers, we’ve got chaplain, and we’ve got the hospital inside, to meet the basic human rights needs of a person who is in custody. He is able to read something while he is inside as well,” said KZN Regional Commissioner Mnikelwa Nxele. Nxele said conditions at Ebongweni prison suits the kind of criminals kept there. He added that the prison is open to further scrutiny on the treatment of inmates. eNCA’s Siphamandla Goge compiled this report after gaining exclusive access to the facility.
