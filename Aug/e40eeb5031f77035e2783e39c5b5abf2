JOHANNESBURG - ANC's Sub-Committee Chair of Economic Transformation Enoch Godongwana says land has already been identified for expropriation without compensation. Speaking at an ANC media briefing in the wake of its two-day lekgotla in Tshwane, Godongwana said, “We have identified land which we will be testing whether it permits for land expropriation without compensation. We won’t say which land for now.” Godongwane added that they are not undermining the parliamentary process but they see that their people are in favour of amending Section 25 of the Constitution. “We have been watching all the public hearings and there is an overwhelming view to expropriate land without compensation.” ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule said the party is convinced South Africans have voiced their opinion that Section 25 of the Constitution must be amended to expropriate land without compensation. This comes after President Cyril Ramphosa announced that the ANC will go ahead with plans to amend the constitution to allow for the expropriation of land without compensation.
