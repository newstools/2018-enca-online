JOHANNESBURG - ANC's Sub-Committee Chair of Economic Transformation Enoch Godongwana says land has already been identified for expropriation without compensation. Speaking at an ANC media briefing in the wake of its two-day lekgotla in Tshwane, Godongwana said, “We have identified land which we will be testing whether it permits for land expropriation without compensation. We won’t say which land for now.” Godongwane added that they are not undermining the parliamentary process but they see that their people are in favour of amending Section 25 of the Constitution. “We have been watching all the public hearings and there is an overwhelming view to expropriate land without compensation.” [JUST-IN] #ANCNECLekgotla Gondongwana:We have identified land which we will be testing at the Concourt with the current Constitution whether its permits for Land Expropriation Without Constitution.
