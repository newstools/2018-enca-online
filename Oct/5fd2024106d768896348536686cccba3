WORCESTER - The romantic relationship between two deaf people ended in a double tragedy on Tuesday morning at the National Institute for the Deaf in Worcester. A former student of the Institute for the Deaf broke into a female student’s residence and stabbed her to death before killing himself. It was the first time in the institute’s 137 years that a murder was committed on its premises. "At around 4:30 I was called by security about the incident that had happened,” said National Institute for the Deaf CEO Cobus van Deventer “The man had gained access to the ladies res by breaking into the sitting room before going to her room. “There were five other women in her room, the ladies share rooms, who saw some of the incident but one saw all of it while the others left the room. By the time security arrived, it was all over, it happened so fast. I believe he was on a mission."

The 23-year-old man had apparently visited the woman at her residence on Monday night, seeking answers about the state of their relationship. Students are now receiving counselling. "The atmosphere on campus is sad and we halted all classes yesterday,” said Van Deventer. “Luckily we have social workers on campus as well as a church so everyone was divided into groups for counselling immediately. “Those who need it will be referred for further counselling. “We have looked at security measures but we believe that the security on campus is already enough and there was nothing that would’ve prevented this man from entering as he already had friends on campus and he knew his way around." The students' families were still making their way to Worcester on Wednesday morning.
