JOHANNESBURG - The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has welcomed the recall of President Jacob Zuma, but says it will continue with its motion of no confidence in him. EFF chief whip in Parliament Floyd Shivambu called on the ANC caucus to support its motion of no confidence. "We are calling on the ANC to rise above the narrow partisanship and unite the whole Parliament. Let us go for the first time 100 percent all of us to vote the constitutional delinquent out of office. That is what we have to do to show unity, at least on this point, to say that Zuma cannot continue to be the president," Shivambu said.
