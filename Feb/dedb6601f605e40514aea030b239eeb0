PARLIAMENT - National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete on Monday turned down a request by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) to bring forward the debate on their latest motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma, as he resists pressure from the ANC to resign. "The Speaker has responded in the negative," an opposition source said. Mbete had scheduled the vote on the motion for the February 22, a day after the budget speech is due to be tabled.

Opposition parties have said the impasse made Ramaphosa, also the ANC president, appear weak. The ANC was due to hold a special meeting of its National Executive Committee on Monday to discuss Zuma's fate. The party is understood to be resolved to remove Zuma without the help of an opposition motion. African News Agency
