JOHANNESBURG – Former Western Cape Police Commissioner Arno Lamoer has been found guilty of corruption. Judgment was handed down in the Western Cape High Court in Cape Town on Monday afternoon. Lamoer admitted to writing letters of good standing for businessman Salim Dawjee while serving as provincial commissioner from 2011 to 2013. In exchange, Lamoer was lent money by Dawjee to pay for some of his personal expenses, like clothing accounts and fuel. In some cases, the money was in the form of loans and at times, payments were made for favours. Earlier this month, Lamoer pleaded guilty to one of the corruption charges he faced. All suspects had initially pleaded not guilty.
