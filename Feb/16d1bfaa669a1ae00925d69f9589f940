LONDON - Manchester United star Juan Mata dedicated his side's 2-0 victory against Huddersfield to the victims of the Munich disaster and their families. Tuesday is the 60th anniversary of the air disaster that killed 23 people, including eight of United's famous Busby Babes team, as the club made their way back from a European Cup tie at Red Star Belgrade. United and Huddersfield players paid tribute to the victims of the 1958 plane crash with one minute's silence ahead of Saturday's Premier League match against Huddersfield at Old Trafford.

A special ceremony will be held at Old Trafford on Tuesday and, after goals from Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez saw off Huddersfield, Mata said United's victory was a fitting tribute. "Obviously it was a special game, a very sad memory," Spain midfielder Mata said. "It was a thing that changed the history of the club and the club showed the passion and the energy that we all have in Manchester United. "So, we pay respect to the victims and their families, and they will always be in our memories. "It was a game to win for them and we did it." AFP
