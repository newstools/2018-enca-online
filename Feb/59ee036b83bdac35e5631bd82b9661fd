JOHANNESBURG – The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) in Mpumalanga has expressed its disappointment at the pace in which the Department of Mineral Resources is moving in dealing with the resolutions of the Lily mine crisis. The trade unions says it is concerned about workers of suspended mines in Babrock and Lily mine. Three mineworkers were trapped underground at Lily Mine in Mpumalanga. Operations to recover the bodies of Yvonne Mnisi, Pretty Nkambule and Solomon Nyerende stalled since February 2016. Authorities said at the time that it was unsafe for rescuers to continue. The union has expressed issues with workers who were rescued. READ: Minister Zwane’s Lily Mine promises were a populist stunt: NUM Youth “Mines remain suspended while workers are left in the ledge with no income and means of survival,” it said in a statement. “There are still outstanding payments of rescued mine workers who have not received a cent as compensation since the promises made by the Minister of DMR Mosebenzi Zwane.” It [Cosatu] has since called upon Zwane to speed up processes in resolving the matter and treat it as that of urgency. "Cosatu calls upon ...Zwane to have conscious and empathy by ensuring that the crisis is resolved as matter of urgency and the affected families find closure." eNCA
