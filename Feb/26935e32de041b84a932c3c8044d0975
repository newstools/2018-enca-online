JOHANNESBURG - The Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution says it doesn't want NPA head, Shaun Abrahams, involved in the Zuma matter. Abrahams is expected to reveal in two weeks' time whether he'll charge the former president. READ: NPA makes decision on Zuma prosecution "Given the fact that the matter will come before the court in less than 48 hours it is our view that it would not be appropriate to waive that notice period," says Lawson Naidoo, Casac. Naidoo says they've argued before the court that it would be inappropriate for Abrahams to make this decision given the uncertainty about his continuing in office. "It would be in the best interest of justice in terms of the people of SA and the intergrity of the NPA for a decision to be taken by the head of the NPA once the Constitutional Court has ruled in this case," says Naidoo. eNCA
