JOHANNESBURG - UDM leader Bantu Holomisa says he's not surprised by the DA's latest move on Cape Town mayor Patricia De Lille. The DA has laid bribery and corruption charges against De Lille. READ: De Lille dodges another bullet "Once they differ with you they get into a gear of discrediting you. We have seen with Bobane, remember the leader of DA in a metro as well Trollip were telling people all over the country that they have prima facie evidence of corruption against  Bobane. We have challenged them, we said table in the council or give us copy of that. It turned out that they were lying," says Holomisa. "Today the PWC final report is with the mayor and some of the people that were suspended have been told to go back and work. And there is nothing that refer to Bobane. Same thing is happening with De Lille in Cape Town. Once they differ with you they use an old apartheid tactic of discrediting you. But in the UDM we have taught them a lesson that we are not going to be tossed around," he says. eNCA
