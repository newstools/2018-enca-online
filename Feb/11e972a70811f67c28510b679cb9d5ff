CAPE TOWN - EFF leader Julius Malema says the ANC's call for President Jacob Zuma to step down is motivated by factional battles. Malema was speaking at a media briefing outlining opposition parties' plans to have Zuma removed. "Why the ANC is not telling the reason why they want Zuma to go. People wake up in the morning and they are all saying, 'We are in a discussion. We are all saying Zuma must go, Zuma must go.' And then no one asks them the question why Zuma must go. You know the reason of the opposition," said Malema. REVEALED: What's holding up the Zuma exit talks "The ANC says Zuma must go for factional reasons. That is why you see Derek Hanekom dancing the way he's dancing right now. He is happy that it is their time to eat. It is a factional reason why they want Zuma to go," he said. The ANC was hijacking the "genuine programme to demand Zuma to go" because this was to get rid of corruption. "Why are they not saying through their mouths, 'We want Zuma to go because he is corrupt, the court has found that he violated his oath of office.' They have never said that because they agreed with everything that Zuma stands for. They want to continue with the same thing when they take power. They wantÂ  Zuma to go because it is the time for Cyril's group to eat." eNCA
