PYEONGCHANG, South Korea - Austria’s David Gleirscher claimed a dramatic gold in the men’s luge after two-time reigning champion felix loch stumbled in his last run on Sunday at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. The 23-year-old Austrian moved to the top of the standings with a composed final run, but Germany’s Loch needed only to complete an error-free effort to be assured of a third successive gold. Having been flawless all weekend, the 28-year-old Loch crashed into the wall early in his final run, knocking him off medal pace and leaving a disbelieving Gleirscher jumping for joy in the leader's booth. His gold is Austria’s first in the event for 50 years at an Olympic Winter Games. Gleirscher claimed the title with an aggregate time of three minutes 10.702 seconds, just 0.026 seconds ahead of runner-up Chris Mazdzer of the USA. Germany's Johannes Ludwig won the bronze, while Loch could only finish fifth, ending eight years of Olympic dominance and his bid to match compatriot Georg Hackl's hat-trick of luge titles in the 1990s.
