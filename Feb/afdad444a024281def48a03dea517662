JOHANNESBURG – Local government bonds were softer on Friday morning‚ in line with the rand‚ which came under pressure amid a dollar recovery. Local focus is on a meeting of senior ANC officials this weekend. Reports have suggested the ANC national executive committee (NEC) will meet on Sunday amid speculation that President Cyril Ramaphosa is close to announcing a Cabinet reshuffle. The rand should remain range-bound until any political news was announced due to the absence of major data releases‚ said TreasuryOne currency dealer Phillip Pearce.
