JOHANNESBURG – South African National Parks (SanParks) is considering rolling out unmanned, aerial drones to monitor Table Mountain National Park. The body responsible for managing South Africa's national parks has come under heavy criticism for failing to provide adequate security on its trails. There has been a spate of robberies and violent attacks on hikers and other visitors at tourist destinations in Cape Town. Last month, a 56-year-old man was stabbed to death on the hiking trail above Kalk Bay.

We are in talks with technological suppliers, in terms of increasing signal, so we can have more access to cellphone technology and the app,” Collins added. eNCA
