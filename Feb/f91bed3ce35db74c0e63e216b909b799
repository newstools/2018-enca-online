JOHANNESBURG - Residents of Slovoville, Soweto protested at the Doornkop gold mine on Friday demanding that they be given preference when the mine is recruiting. Max Manoeli, investor relations co-ordinator for Harmony Gold, which owns the mine, said the community had gone against a memorandum of understanding both parties had signed two weeks ago after a protest. They had agreed then on a range of ways the mine could continue helping its neighbours. "Harmony spent R17-million on developments at Slovoville between 2012 and 2016," Manoeli said. The development projects ranged from primary school to digital hubs.

Mine management was engaging with the demonstrators and there had not been any violence, he said. eNCA
