JOHANNESBURG - For a team that has won the Nedbank Cup back to back, one would have thought that SuperSport United head coach Eric Tinkler will be setting his eyes on this silverware. The Tshwane-based side's mentor has other plans. Tinkler has admitted that he will be prioritising the league over the Ke Yona Cup. Despite being the defending champions of the competition, Tinkler has disclosed that he will be resting most of his senior players when they travel to Free State to play Bloemfontein Celtic on Sunday at the Dr Petrus Molemela Stadium. “We are making a few changes to the team as we need to because of the heavy schedule we had,  and due to the fact that, right now, the league is our priority," he said "We have three massive games coming after Celtic. Two of those are so important, we have Platinum Stars and Ajax Cape Town, before playing Mamelodi Sundowns, so obviously our priority needs to be there,” Tinkler said. SuperSport are currently struggling in the league, having managed to secure only two wins from their last nine matches. Matsatsantsa A Pitori are 11th on the Absa premiership table with 24 points from 20 games. Tinkler will be hoping his young squad displays the same performance they did when they registered their biggest win of the season by beating Celtic 4-2 in a league match last week. "It is going to be a tough encounter for us as we have come through a rough patch for the club. We had nine games in 20 days and the results have also not been good. Yes, we have to beat them but like I said, it is going to be a difficult game for us,” Tinkler concluded. Kickoff is scheduled for 3.30pm. eNCA
