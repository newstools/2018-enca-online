ROTTERDAM, Netherlands - Belgian David Goffin brushed aside Nicolas Mahut in straight sets on Tuesday to reach the last 16 at the Rotterdam Open. The fourth seed came through 6-1, 6-3 to post his fourth victory over the Frenchman in five meetings. World number seven Goffin, last year's losing finalist, totally dominated as he set up a second-round tie with Spaniard Feliciano Lopez, winning in just 64 minutes. Roger Federer opens his campaign at the Ahoy Arena on Wednesday, with the Swiss looking to overtake Rafael Nadal and become the oldest-ever world number one by reaching the semi-finals. Earlier on Tuesday, ninth seed Gilles Muller of Luxembourg lost to Russian qualifier Daniil Medvedev 6-4, 7-6 (11/9). Serb Viktor Troicki saw off Jan-Lennard Struff 1-6, 7-6 (7/5), 6-2, while Struff's fellow German Philipp Kohlschreiber fought back to beat Russia's Karen Khachanov 3-6, 7-6 (7/1), 7-6 (7/5).
