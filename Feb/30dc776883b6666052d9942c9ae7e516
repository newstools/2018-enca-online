CAPE T0WN – No new avian flu outbreaks have been reported on commercial farms but the impact of the virus has contributed to a loss of over R900-million. Parliament’s portfolio committee on Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries received a report from the South African Poultry Association on Tuesday on the impact of avian flu in South Africa. Parliament has been informed that as of 9 January 2018, no new outbreaks have been reported on commercial farms. However, since June last year, there has been a steady decline in the production of eggs and chickens and South Africa has to rely on imported chickens to meet the demand.

Semenya advised both the department and the association to meet and then table a comprehensive report before the committee on issues that were raised in this meeting. eNCA
