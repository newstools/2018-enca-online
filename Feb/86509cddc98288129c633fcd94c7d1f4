JOHANNESBURG - Cape Town mayor Patricia De Lille has lashed out at the DA for laying bribery and corruption charges against her. The charges are related to a claim by a Gauteng businessman that De Lille tried to solicit a R5-million bribe from him in 2012. READ: New charges laid against Patricia De Lille "It is another move by the DA to dent my reputation. It is so convenient this guy come after 6 years after he claimed I solicited a bribe. Also the time when the DA is charging me. It is also raising a lot of questions. I have never been officially informed by the police on these charges. But should I be informed I will cooperate with the police and I will go to court to clear my name. But the DA is hell-bent on smearing my name. They believe in the old strategy that if you repeat the message," she said. "The only thing that I have been asking for six months now let us test these allegations. Create the structure where we can test them. The DA is missing a golden opportunity to show South African that they are party of systems and due process and that we are equally before the law and the country's constitution. I am ready to defend myself they can come up with all these charges and allegation against me. If they are so sure if these things will stick on me one day why can’t they allow me to be charged and let's test those allegations," said De Lille. eNCA
