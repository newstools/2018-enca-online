MILAN, Italy - French midfielder Blaise Matuidi is back training with Juventus but full-back Mattia De Sciglio is sidelined with a thigh injury, the Serie A champions said on Wednesday. Juventus said that De Sciglio was having problems with the left thigh injury he picked up in Sunday's 1-0 derby win against Torino and "further tests will be carried out in the next days". Matuidi suffered a slight tear to his left thigh muscle two weeks ago and missed Serie A games against Fiorentina and Torino and the Champions League last 16 first leg 2-2 draw against Tottenham. The 30-year-old returned to training and is expected to line up in Sunday's Serie A game against Atalanta and the Italian Cup semi-final second leg match on Wednesday against the side from Bergamo. De Sciglio, however, could miss the Serie A trip to Lazio on March 3 and the Champions League second leg at Wembley four days later. AFP
