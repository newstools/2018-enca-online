PARIS – Stars attending the "French Oscars" – the Cesars – on Friday will wear a white ribbon in protest at violence against women, organisers said. "We are all going to wear white ribbons," Alain Terzian, the head of the French Academy told AFP on Tuesday after actors and directors at the Golden Globes and the British Bafta awards wore black in solidarity with the #MeToo movement.

The Cesars sparked feminist fury last year by inviting controversial Franco-Polish director Roman Polanski to preside over the awards before he was forced to pull out. The veteran filmmaker – who has been accused of sexual assault by several women – is wanted in the United States for the statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl in 1977. Terzian said the Franco-American actress and director Tonie Marshall came up with the white ribbon idea to support a French foundation that works to stop violence against women. "We will all wear the ribbon with conviction and determination," he added.

She said only one in five feature films subsidised by the French state every year is made by women. The situation is Hollywood is even worse, with only seven percent of the top 250 films in 2016 directed by women. AFP
