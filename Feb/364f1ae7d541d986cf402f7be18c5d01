JOHANNESBURG -Â The Competition Commission has referred SA Airlink for prosecution on excessive pricing. The commission wants a penalty of 10 percent of the airline's annual turnover. The complaints were about the Johannesburg Mthatha route. The carrier allegedly had excessive prices until another airline entered the route in 2016. Airlink then dropped their prices to below cost forcing the other airline to drop the route. After the exit, the airline increased its prices. eNCA
