JOHANNESBURG – The sacrifices of the Fee Must Fall movement have not gone unnoticed, Higher Education Minister Hlengiwe Mkhize said on Friday. She was addressing University of Cape Town students about fee-free higher education after R57-billion was allocated in Wednesday's budget for first-year tertiary students. “You must appreciate this because we are talking about your sacrifices,” the minister said. “Many of you sacrificed attending classes, confronted the police, some went through extremes - they are going through rehabilitation of norms and standards of behaviour on campus, but here we are today. At least the announcement acknowledged what you said.” Mkhize went on to explain why first year tertiary students from families earning a combined income of up to R350,000, qualify for the fee waiver. “There are many things that were recommended by the commission on fee-free education. They have recommended that all students, whether in private universities or colleges, should be funded,” she explained. “The debt of the country would grow higher and higher, so we limited it to people who are in great need, for now,” Mkhize added. WATCH: Free higher education funds itself, Zuma 'adviser' says She called on universities to make safety and gender equality a top priority. “On the issue of security on campuses, are we still going to find people who are accused of violating the rights of women? Are we still going to find people who are guilty of sexual assault on campus,” the minister asked. She said in some cases, people dropped out of universities because of violence perpetuated against women. eNCA
