JOHANNESBURG - The Public Service Commission (PSC) has agreed to probe a complaint by the DA into possible abuse of office by the Minister of Public Service and Administration Faith Muthambi., who is accused of hiring "family and friends". Muthambi has denied the allegation that she had appointed 27 people to her private office, more than what she is entitled to according to the ministerial handbook.
