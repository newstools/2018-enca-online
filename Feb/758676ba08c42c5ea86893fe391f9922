JOHANNESBURG – Twitter is shaking after realizing that polygamist Musa Mseleku is able to heal sick people.  Musa Mseleku (Picture: Mzansi magic) WATCH: Musa Mseleku, wives talk about Love and Polygamy On last night's episode of Mzansi Magic’s Uthando Nest’hembu, Musa Mseleku revealed how he was able to heal a sick young boy who was at that time unable to speak. I disagree with the statement "Christians are Judgemental" but would agree if it was "Black Christians Are Judgemental" white are not coz they understand God is for every1. All the Chinese,Indians,Muslims all over the world will go to hell? God is your only?Wow #Uthandonesthembu pic.twitter.com/GOYbdzCi1Q This sparked a conversation on Twitter about Christianity and ancestors. Musa shares his gift of healing with those in need https://t.co/1cK2yHl4aZ #UthandoNesthembu pic.twitter.com/ANcTcSJ59X #Uthandonesthembu Is Musa healing in da name of God or ancestors?

		Joshua 12: 14 says ‘And if it is evil in your eyes to serve the Lord, choose this day whom you will serve...Meaning if it’s God , it’s Him alone, you don’t mix Him with oil , water, petrol, doom, idols, ancestors, or worshipping your pastor...
