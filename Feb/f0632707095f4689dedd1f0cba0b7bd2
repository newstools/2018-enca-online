JOHANNESBURG - The Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) has raised concerns about the appointment of former Mpumalanga premier David Mabuza as the deputy president of South Africa. In a statement released on Tuesday, the organisation said Mabuza's appointment posed a threat to the struggle against HIV and TB in the country. Mabuza was appointed with other cabinet members by President Cyril Ramaphosa on Monday evening. As the country's deputy president, Mabuza will chair the South African National AIDS Council (SANAC). "Mabuza’s premiership in Mpumalanga has been mired in corruption allegations and mismanagement impacting various sectors of society including health. TAC is concerned that under Mabuza’s leadership an already struggling SANAC will become completely ineffectual. “As premier, Mabuza failed to take a lead as Chairperson of the Mpumalanga Provincial AIDS Council, allowing the civil society co-Chairperson to run the show. As deputy president, will he suddenly now take SANAC seriously and see HIV and TB as a priority or will he allow the structure to collapse?” TAC Mpumalanga chairperson Nqobile Shabalala said.

"In her role at the Department of Social Development she has shown a complete lack of leadership and almost collapsed the social grants system on which many poor women and their children rely. In her capacity as president of the ANC Women’s League she has often undermined rather than promoted the role of women in the ANC," TAC said in statetement. The organisation said all public officials should be appointed based on their ability and their commitment to serve the people and not to balance "factions" in the party. eNCA
