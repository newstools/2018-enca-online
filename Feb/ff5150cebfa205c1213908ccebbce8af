JOHANNESBURG – South Africa awaits to see if President Jacob Zuma will step down or not as speculation mounts about his future as the country’s president. There have been a host of “urgent” and "constructive" meetings as well as some meeting cancellations. Parliament on Tuesday postponed the State of the Nation Address (SONA), which was supposed to take place on Thursday. ANC Treasurer General Paul Mashatile, in an audio clip, confirmed Zuma refused to resign when they met with him on Sunday.
