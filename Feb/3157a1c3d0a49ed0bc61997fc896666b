JOHANNESBURG – The Momentum One-Day Cup title has been shared by the Dolphins and the Warriors after the second attempt to play the final failed due to rain at Kingsmead in Durban on Saturday. Good afternoon and welcome to the #MODC final re-run. It's the @DolphinsCricket v @WarriorsCrickEC from Durban, where yesterday's initial clash had to be abandoned after nearly 40 overs due to rain. It has been drizzling most of the morning, so the toss is delayed pic.twitter.com/tT4gM4Ty8W The match on the reserve day was abandoned without a ball being bowled – a little under 24 hours after the initial clash had to be called off for the same reason on Friday. The first attempt at least saw 39.4 overs being bowled, but there was no action at all on the second attempt after it rained through the night and continued to drizzle for large parts of Saturday in the east coast city. The rain has stopped in Durban the super-sopper has been whipped out. It's doing a job so far. Remember that rain has stopped the #MODC final with @DolphinsCricket 154/6 (39.4 overs) v @WarriorsCrickEC.

There was no loser in the end with the Dolphins going on to secure their first 50-over trophy of the franchise era – a wait of 16 years. For the Warriors, it was their first trophy since they won both white-ball titles back in 2009/10. African News Agency
