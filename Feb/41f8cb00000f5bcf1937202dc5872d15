JOHANNESBURG - The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) has issued a summons against former SABC chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng for more than R21-million he owes the public broadcaster, the DA spokesman on communications, Phumzile van Damme, says. According to the DA, the R21-million includes a R11.4-million "success fee" he received for the so-called MultiChoice “archives deal” and R10.5-million in damages related to the irregular appointment and dismissal of staff. READ: DA calls for Motsoeneng's head "It is to be welcomed that action against Motsoeneng continues," says Van Damme. "It cannot be that individuals like Motsoeneng loot public institutions, resign or are dismissed and there is no further action. All stolen money must be returned to the public purse. We therefore welcome the SIU’s action in this regard," she says. Van Damme says the SIU is investigating eight contracts that were identified as "dodgy" during the SABC ad-hoc inquiry, including the "questionable R460-million contract with MultiChoice". She says the SUI plans to hand over the Interim Presidential Report on its investigations into these dodgy contracts to the Office of the President on 31 May. eNCA
