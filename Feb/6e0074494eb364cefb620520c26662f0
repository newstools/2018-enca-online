JOHANNESBURG - Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has arrived back at St George Hotel in Irene, Pretoria just before midnight on Monday. The other members of the ANC national executive committee (NEC) remained at the venue after he left at about 10.30pm, following a marathon meeting of the executive. 22:34 Presidential Protection Service convoy leaves St George Hotel in Irene - presumably with ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa. #ANCNEC pic.twitter.com/lkf5PnrqO2 Interestingly there’s been no exodus of other NEC members leaving the venue in Irene, after the Presidential Protection Service motorcade left some 30 minutes ago. Many of them staying put for now. #ANCNEC The NEC meeting began at 2pm and there has been no update on its discussion of Zuma's future as president. Earlier on Monday, all the opposition parties in Parliament called for the vote of no-confidence in Zuma to be moved forward to Tuesday and for Parliament to be dissolved. EFF leader Julius Malema threatened to go to court if National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete doesn’t respond by 10am on Tuesday to the call to bring the motion of no confidence forward. The motion is scheduled to be tabled on 22 February. The postponement of the State of the Nation Address last week sent the country into a tail-spin, which was followed by talks of an exit plan for Zuma. An NEC meeting that was scheduled for Wednesday last week was called off by Ramaphosa, who said his talks with Zuma had been constructive and laid the basis for a speedy resolution to the leadership question. On Saturday, the ANC's top six officials met without Zuma, but there was no media briefing afterwards. eNCA
