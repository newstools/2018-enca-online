JOHANNESBURG – South Africa have been fined for maintaining a slow over-rate in Saturday’s  fourth one-day international against India in Johannesburg, which they won by five wickets to keep the series alive. Andy Pycroft of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Match Referees imposed the fine after Aiden Markram’s side was ruled to be one over short of their target when time allowances were taken into consideration.

As such, Markram has been fined 20-percent of his match fee, while his players have received 10 percent fines. If South Africa commit another minor over-rate breach in an ODI within 12 months of this offence with Markram as captain, it will be deemed a second offence by Markram and he will face a suspension.

The charge was levelled by on-field umpires Aleem Dar and Bongani Jele, third umpire Ian Gould, and fourth umpire Shaun George. African News Agency
