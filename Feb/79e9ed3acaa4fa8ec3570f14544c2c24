After the women's free skating, Canada had already secured first place, with ice dancers Virtue and Moir still left to compete. With the pressure taken off them, the pair were outstanding, finishing first with 118.10 points, six points ahead of US skaters Maia and Alex Shibutani, who helped the USA win bronze. The 27-year-old Chan, who had struggled with his jumps in the team event’s short programme, landed the first two quads of his free skate. Skating in his third and final Olympic Winter Games, he earned a season's best score of 179.75 points. Afterwards, Chan said: “I’m just happy I did the best I could. I achieved a big thing, which was to land the two big quads in one programme. “I’m going to hold this medal tight to me.” Chan won silver in the team and men’s singles events at Sochi 2014, is a three-time world champion but has never won Olympic gold until now.
