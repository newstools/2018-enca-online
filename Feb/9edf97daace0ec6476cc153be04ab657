JOHANNESBURG - The Thabo Mbeki Foundation has welcomed the ANC's decision to recall President Jacob Zuma. The foundation says the move is in the country's best interests because, among other reasons, Zuma faces the possibility of prosecution. It's also called on Zuma to tender his resignation to the Speaker of the National Assembly. WATCH: ANC confirms it is recalling Zuma A number of other organisations have also welcomed the news.
