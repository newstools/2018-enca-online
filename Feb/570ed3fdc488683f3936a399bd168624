JOHANNESBURG â€“ It was a frustrating Saturday night for Kaizer Chiefs at the FNB Stadium after they failed to break down a stubborn Bloemfontein Celtic in a 0-0 league draw. The result, after 90 minutes in Johannesburg in which Chiefs had dominated both ball possession and chances on goal, means that Steve Komphela's side remain five points behind league leaders Sundowns, who had earlier on Saturday dropped two points in a 1-1 draw with SuperSport United. Match Highlights #AbsaPrem #KCOneTeam pic.twitter.com/9Sj9xHF3EK Chiefs assumed command from the outset and there was early work for Celtic keeper Patrick Tingyemb to do when he got down well to keep out a Leonardo Castro shot after five minutes. But for the most part, Tingyemb remained untested as Siyabonga Ngezana headed over the bar before Castro did the same with a volley on 30 minutes, the Colombian also slashing a shot wide a few minutes later. Amakhosi remained on top after the restart and kept the pressure on Phunya Sele Sele as Castro got in a shot from inside the box, easily saved by Tingyemb, who also kept out a well-struck Wiseman Meyiwa strike. Celtic had one or two sniffs at goal, including a half chance for Deon Hotto, but the momentum remained firmly with the Glamour Boys as Ryan Moon tested Tingyemb with a stinging drive before Daniel Cardoso's header from a corner hit the crossbar. Bernard Parker wasted another good opportunity in the 78th minute when he fell back and lifted the ball over the goal from 16-yards out, as Chiefs continued to try and press home the advantage. The final minutes of the match belonged almost entirely to the hosts, but they just could not come up with something special to break down a resolute Celtic rear-guard and had to settle for the point. The draw extends Chiefs' unbeaten league run to nine games and takes them back above Maritzburg United into the second position. African News Agency
