The authority denies feeling pressured over the imminent change in the political landscape. In October, Zuma lost his appeal against a high court ruling that charges against him should be reinstated. On January 31, he filed papers with the NPA explaining why he should not face fraud and corruption charges. The NPA had set an initial deadline of 30 November last year, but Zuma asked and was granted a seven-week extension. On 30 November, the Democratic Alliance (DA) filed papers with the NPA outlining why 783 counts of corruption, fraud, money laundering, and racketeering against Zuma should immediately be instituted. - Additional reporting African News Agency eNCA
