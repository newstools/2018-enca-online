JOHANNESBURG – According to coach Ashwell Prince, the Cape Cobras are quietly confident heading into their Sunfoil Series clash with the Highveld Lions starting at Boland Park on Thursday.

Yet, those call-ups create opportunities for younger players eager to please and to throw their hats into the franchise arena. The hosts will be without Vernon Philander, who had a cortisone injection into his ankle two weeks ago. Yet, in the build-up to the match against the Lions, he has not had sufficient time in the nets to be selected for the Cobras. Dane Paterson was also rewarded for his strong performances in the Ram Slam T20 Challenge with a call-up to the South African T20 squad. African News Agency
