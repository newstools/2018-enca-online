JOHANNESBURG - One year after South Sudan briefly declared a famine, more than half of the country’s population face extreme hunger amid civil war and famine could return, according to a new report by the South Sudan government and the UN. Without humanitarian aid the lives of more than six million people, up from about 40 percent from a year ago, remain at risk says the report released on Monday.
