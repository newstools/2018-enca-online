READ: Former Western Cape police boss in court for racketeering Arno Lamoer has admitted to writing letters of good standing for businessman Dawjee, a friend he has known for over twenty years, while serving as the provincial commissioner between 2011 to 2013. In exchange, Lamoer was lent money by Dawjee to pay for some of his personal expenses, like clothing accounts and fuel. In some cases the money was a loan. In most instances they were payments for favours. The same for brigadiers Darius van der Ross and Colin Govender. Tow truck company owner, Dawjee, admits to the loans to Lamoer, of over R60,000 rand. Govender’s wife, Sharon, who was also arrested, has pleaded not guilty. The court will decide next week, whether to withdraw other charges the accused face. The case has been postponed to next Monday. eNCA
