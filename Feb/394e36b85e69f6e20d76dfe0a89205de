CAPE TOWN - ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa was engaged in a range of activities in Cape Town on Sunday morning as the country still awaited news on the fate of embattled head of state Jacob Zuma. Ramaphosa attended a service at St George's Cathedral on Sunday morning and was set to be the main speaker at the centennial celebrations of anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela's birth which were set to take place at the Grand Parade in the city. Sunday also marks 28 years since Mandela was released from decades in prison and made his first public address from the City Hall balcony overlooking the Grand Parade. Earlier on Sunday, the ANC called a special national executive committee (NEC) meeting for Monday, with speculation mounting that Zuma's exit is imminent. A smiling Ramaphosa, meanwhile, could be seen emerging from St George's cathedral, greeting members of the public, and at one stage picking up a small child.

The ANC leadership under party president Ramaphosa are engaged in crucial talks with Zuma over the latter's exit from public office. On Friday, the party announced that the programmes of the rest of its top six officials, including secretary-general Ace Magashule, had also been cancelled, this as speculation reached fever pitch that Zuma was on the verge of exiting office. In a momentous week in national politics, Parliament's presiding officers on Tuesday took the unprecedented step of postponing the State of the Nation Address (SONA) which had been scheduled for Thursday evening, while the ANC unexpectedly cancelled a crucial meeting that was supposed to provide clarity on Zuma's future.
