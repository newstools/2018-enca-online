JOHANNESBURG - The NPA's Asset Forfeiture Unit has identified Atul Gupta as a criminal suspect in its Estina Dairy Farm investigation. The AFU says it has clear evidence that Gupta received an unlawful R10-million payment linked to the farm project. UPDATE: Hawks arrest three people in connection with Vrede farm scandal The unit has also criticised Guptaâ€™s attempt to challenge the freezing of this money, calling it baffling and bewildering. Gupta and six companies linked to his family are fighting a preservation order that freezes over R70-million linked to the Estina Dairy Farm. There have been several arrests linked to the project. eNCA
