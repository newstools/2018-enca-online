JOHANNESBURG - Swallows coach Isaac Mphasane says he has a plan in place to upset Maritzburg United when they clash in the last 32 of the Nedbank Cup on Saturday at Dobsonville Stadium, Soweto. Kick-off is scheduled for 3.30pm. Mphasane understands that the KwaZulu-Natal-based side won't make things easy for them but he has assured Swallows supporters that the team will not go down without a fight. “It won’t be easy playing against Maritzburg, as they’re playing in the PSL. But I think it is the right platform for ABC Motsepe teams to play against such teams. I know it is going to be a difficult game but at least I know my opponents and how they play. “We have lots of talented players in the ABC Motsepe league and maybe this is an opportunity for some of them to be seen by the top coaches in the PSL and hopefully be signed," he said. The Ke Yona cup is well known for producing surprises, with lower-ranked teams often humiliating big clubs from the premier league. On Wednesday, National First Division side Ubuntu Cape Town defeated Polokwane City 3-2 to book their place in the round of 16, while Amazulu needed penalty shoot-outs to clinch a win over Mthatha Bucks after playing 2-2. eNCA
