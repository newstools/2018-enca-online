JOHANNESBURG - The rand firmed against major global currencies on Wednesday afternoon after Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba announced R85.7-billion in spending cuts over the next three years. The government had made “significant changes” to the fiscal framework‚ hiking VAT and cutting expenditure in order to reduce the deficit to 3.5 percent by the 2020-21 financial year‚ Gigaba said. “These fiscal proposals will cause discomfort‚ but are necessary to protect the integrity of the fiscus.” READ: Rand weaker ahead of Budget 2018 After trading at about R11.72/$ shortly before Gigaba began speaking in Parliament‚ the rand reached an intraday best of R11.6247 before paring gains. At 2.41pm the rand was at R11.6555 to the dollar from Tuesday’s R11.7301; R14.3442 to the euro from R14.4706; and at R16.2331 to the pound from R16.4173. The euro was at $1.2308 from $1.2336. The budget deficit is being closely watched ahead of Moody’s next rating determination‚ scheduled for March. Should Moody’s downgrade South Africa's credit rating to sub-investment grade‚ local bonds will fall off international bond indices‚ prompting automatic selling by institutional investors. Moody’s should respond to the budget in the coming days‚ which should prompt further rand volatility‚ analysts said. Global focus is on the minutes of the US Federal Reserve’s January meeting‚ expected at 9pm South African time. The minutes will be closely scrutinised for signals on future interest-rate increases. Some market participants expect four rate rises this year‚ as opposed to the Fed’s forward guidance of three.  iNet Bridge
