ROTTERDAM - Roger Federer moved to within two victories of becoming the oldest world number one of all time on Wednesday when he eased past Belgium's Ruben Bemelmans 6-1, 6-2 at the Rotterdam ATP event. The 36-year-old needed just over 45 minutes to clinch victory and next faces Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber in the second round on Thursday. If Federer reaches the semi-finals, he will depose Rafael Nadal on top of the rankings and become the oldest world number one. AFP
