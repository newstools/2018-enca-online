JOHANNESBURG – Kaizer Chiefs defeated Golden Arrows 3-0 in their Nedbank Cup last 32 clash played at the FNB Stadium on Sunday afternoon. In Dr Molemela Stadium Bloemfontein Celtics advanced 5-4 through penalty shootout at the expense of struggling Supersport United following a one all draw after 90 minutes. After a cagey first half, in which both teams kept things tight, the first opportunity fell to Chiefs when Willard Katsande headed a corner-kick from Siphelele Ntshangase wide of goal. Eight minutes into the second, though, Chiefs took the lead when Ryan Moon pounced to stab in when the ball rolled loose after a corner-kick. Moments later, Moon could have doubled the Soweto side’s advantage, but this time his attempt hit the woodwork. Arrows should have equalised through Knox Mutizwa, but, Chiefs goalie Itumeleng Khune came to the rescue of the Glamour boys keeping the lead intact with a great save.

The substitution paid immediate dividends when Parker latched on to a long ball and beat the on-rushing Mbaeva for cool finish into an empty net. Six minutes before full-time, Amakhosi made it 3-0 with a goal from Joseph Molangoane. While Arrows tried their best, in the end, it was Chiefs’ clinical finishing that ensured they go through to the last 16 of the Nedbank Cup. African News Agency
