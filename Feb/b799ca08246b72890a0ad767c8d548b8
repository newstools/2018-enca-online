He said the church has long been linked to suspicious activities. “Two years back we once came here as a community to say that they must stop what they are doing because what they are doing is really funny,” Xuba said. “What I know is that they are keeping young children who should be schooling, they don't allow them to go to school. “They don’t give them their human rights. There are adults who resign, they stay there. It is said that they are taking their monies for years." eNCA
