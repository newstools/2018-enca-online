JOHANNESBURG – Nadia Nakai says that whenever she twerks on stage she does it for women who need a confidence boost. “To be honest every single time I jump on stage to twerk it’s for the woman and not the guys. Women screaming and sharing the excitement shows that they understand the vibe and what I am really about.” After lighting up the stage at the Barcadi Holiday Club at Welgelen Manor in Balfour, the hip-hop sensation spoke to eNCA.com multimedia producer Khumo Pulumo about using rap to uplift and empower woman in South Africa. Signed to rapper Cassper Nyovest’s record label, Family Tree, her love for music began at a young age. At 16, she recorded her first studio song and at 18 she was signed to Sid Records by former YOTV presenter Pysfo. Nakai was born in South Africa and has Zimbabwean origins. She mentions that she prefers American rapper Nicki Minaj over Remy ma because Nicki uplifts and spreads more positivity, whereas Remy portrays women in a bad light. Nakai has graced the pages of Hype Magazine, been a judge for SABC1’s hip-hop show Battle Stations, won against men on e.tv's Shiz-Niz show and was featured on 5fm DJ C-Live’s Taste Makers Mixtape. Her recent hit song, Naaa’Mean -- a colloquial term for comprehending a message -- features Nyovest. Nadia is also well-known for her hit single Bragga, featuring Nyovest, Riky Rick and Gemini Major. eNCA
