JOHANNESBURG - The Freedom Front Plus wants the Free State legislature to postpone the State of the Province Address until a new premier is elected. It says the event will be nothing more than an expensive farewell party for current Premier Ace Magashule. The party says Magashule is expected to resign due to his new full-time position as ANC secretary-general. The address is scheduled to take place on 20 February in Magashuleâ€™s hometown of Parys. eNCA
