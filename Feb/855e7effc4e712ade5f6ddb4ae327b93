PARLIAMENT – The State of the Nation Address (SONA) is ready to go ahead on Thursday. Preparations are underway for President Jacob Zuma to deliver the SONA amid uncertainty that he would step down. The crime tape is up and public order police have set up in Parliament. READ: Whoever is president will deliver SONA: Modise The defence force and explosives unit also arrived on Monday. eNCA Senior Researcher, Angelo Fick outlined the likely scenarios ahead of the SONA. “At the moment we're dealing with the fact that the President of the republic is in office and whoever inhabits that office come Thursday morning will deliver the speech come Thursday evening. So if the president is removed before the SONA by an impeachment vote, the deputy president will have to act as president. If he is removed by the vote of no confidence, the entire cabinet goes with him and that's a whole new ball game and I imagine the entire address will have to be postponed”. eNCA
