JOHANNESBURG - Barclays Bank has been charged with unlawful financial assistance relating to billions of pounds it raised from Qatar about 10 years ago. The BBC reports that Barclays borrowed 12-billion pounds from state-owned Qatar Holdings in 2008 to avoid a government bailout. Britain’s Serious Fraud Office (SFO) believes the loan was used directly or indirectly to buy shares in Barclays, which the watchdog is calling unlawful financial assistance. There could now be a significant risk to the bank’s ability to operate, as its banking licence allows it to operate internationally. If found guilty, it may lose its licence.

AFP reports that the announcement follows a decision by the SFO in June last year to charge Barclays, or the unit's parent group, over the same alleged offence. Barclays and four of its former bosses will face trial in 2019 on allegations over the Qatari fundraising, it had already been announced. Barclays former chief executive John Varley and ex-executives Roger Jenkins, Thomas Kalaris, and Richard Boath have all been charged with conspiracy to commit fraud over a June 2008 bid to raise capital, says AFP. Barclays, Varley and Jenkins have also been charged with providing unlawful assistance over allegations linked to an October 2008 fundraising. It will be the first time that a British bank has faced a criminal trial over its conduct during the financial crisis. eNCA
