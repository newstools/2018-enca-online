JOHANNESBURG - Opposition parties announced their plans following Parliament's announcement that the State of the Nation Address will go ahead as planned. Parties including the EFF, the UDM and the DA have called for Zuma to be replaced before the address. Earlier, National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete had replied to EFF's request to have a motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma be debated before Sona.
