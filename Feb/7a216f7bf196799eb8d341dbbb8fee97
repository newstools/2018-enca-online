KINSHASA – At least 23 members of the Hema ethnic group have been killed since Friday in renewed violence in  Democratic Republic of Congo's Ituri province, a leader of the group said in a statement Monday. A high-ranking provincial official, who did not wish to be named, confirmed the toll since Friday and added that 10 fighters from a rival ethnic group, the Lendu, had died. Hema herders and Lendu farmers have been locked in violence in Ituri province for decades, with tens of thousands killed from 1999 to 2003.

The intervention saw a major drop in the intensity of the violence, but the conflict never came to a total halt, with occasional flare-ups still wracking the area.

"Four people (from the Hema community) died this morning. A police captain died from gunshot wounds and three police were injured," the official said. "Between 500 and 800 families have been displaced," the official added. The Hema community on Monday began two days of mourning, putting a stop to all commercial activity. AFP
