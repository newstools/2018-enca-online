LONDON - West Ham blamed "administrative oversights" for being hit with a Football Association charge for breaching anti-doping rules on Tuesday. An FA statement said the London club "failed to ensure its 'club whereabouts' information was accurate on three occasions within 12 months". West Ham has until February 27 to respond. "The breach relates to administrative oversights on the FA's whereabouts system," West Ham said in a statement. "For example, a player's address had been registered and the house number digits transposed, and the club will be responding to the FA in due course. "We would like to make it clear that the breach is a club administrative matter and does not concern any of our players." AFP
