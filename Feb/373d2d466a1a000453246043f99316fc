JOHANNESBURG - In fashion, what is seen on the streets is just as important as what goes down on the runway. R29's Style Out There takes a look at the drastically different subcultures around the world, examining the myriad of influences that colour what we wear and why. In this particular insert, they take a look at the Herero women of Namibia. The enormous crinoline dress, styled in Victorian tradition, is still strong among the Herero women. Many of them are extremely proud to wear this distinctive fashion. In Namibia, where very hot weather is common in summer, the women deck themselves out with long sleeves and petticoats. Their gorgeous dresses, elaborate headpieces and vibrant patterns showcase their pride in their identity, all the while alluding to the suffering they have endured. The Herero people, once one of the largest groups in Namibia, went through a genocide that nearly wiped them out. eNCA
