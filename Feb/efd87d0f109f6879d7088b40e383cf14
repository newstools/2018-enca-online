JOHANNESBURG - The JSE opened flat on Friday after Thursday’s surge‚ as the market eyed the state of the nation address by newly elected President Cyril Ramaphosa later in the day. “With the Presidency saga now being something of the past‚ the focus has turned to the budget and Moody’s credit rating assessment‚” said TreasuryOne dealer Gerard van der Westhuizen. Industrials were up on a firmer rand‚ along with gold and platinum stocks. The property index was under pressure.
