ROME â€“ The Vatican will lend around 40 ecclesiastical works to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York for an exhibition focusing on the Catholic religion's impact on fashion, organisers said on Monday. Items such as papal rings and crowns worn by various popes from the 18th and 19th centuries will go on display, including precious treasures from the famous Sistine Chapel "never seen outside of the Vatican," organisers said. The exhibition "Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination" will feature items spanning a period of more than 15 papacies.
