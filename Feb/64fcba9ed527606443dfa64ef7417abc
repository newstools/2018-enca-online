JOHANNESBURG – There is a new twist to next month’s South African Football Association (Safa) presidential election. Current president Danny Jordaan has already indicated he will rerun for Safa’s top post on 24 March. However, it looks as though he will have his work cut for him, should former African National Congress MP and Fifa presidential candidate Tokyo Sexwale join the race. A group opposing Jordaan proposed Sexwale as a candidate that they feel will be able to unseat Jordaan. Results of who is preferred Safa President, according to the consulting-with-the-masses process undertaken by the NFCF.
