JOHANNESBURG - Seven people have been arrested at the "Bagdad" flea market in Kliptown, Soweto for allegedly being in possession of suspected stolen City of Johannesburg property, the city said on Saturday. The suspects would appear in the Kliptown Magistrate's Court on Monday, Mayor Herman Mashaba said. "A concerned Joburg citizen contacted the city’s group forensic and investigation service (GFIS) department yesterday [Friday] morning and informed the team about a group of people who stripped building material from the vacant Kliptown RDP houses in Soweto," he said.

"The material was then being sold to the public in the market. When the suspects were questioned about where they got the building material from they became violent and threatened the team," Mashaba said. The GFIS, the Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department and the SA Police Service subsequently raided the market and confiscated building material. "Not very far from the flea market is the Soweto Country Club, where thieves stole 12 panels of Clear-Vu fence in December last year. On Friday, we arrested one suspect who is allegedly involved in the theft of the fence," he said. Mashaba thanked the officials involved in the raid and arrests. African News Agency
