CAPE TOWN – The Speaker of the City of Cape Town council has been tasked to decide whether the vote of no confidence against Mayor Patricia De Lille will be done via secret ballot or not. De Lille wants Thursday's vote of no confidence against her to be held in secret. She welcomed the decision, saying on social media that councillors are now free to decide. I’m happy with the comprehensive judgement received. Judge ruled that I was correct in approaching the court because the DA only agreed to a free vote yday. Now Cllrs are free to decide. Speaker was ordered to use his discretion regarding a secret ballot. The Democratic Alliance, the governing party in the city, is accusing De Lille of maladministration and corruption. Judge Robert Henney also ordered that the DA tell its members that they are free to vote in line with their consciences. De Lille headed to court this week, after the DA's Federal Executive authorised councillors to vote against de Lille along party lines. eNCA
