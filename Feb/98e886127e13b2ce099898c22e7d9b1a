JOHANNESBURG – Taking another step forward in the nation's long-term build-up to the 2019 IAAF World Cross Country Championships in Denmark,  a nine-member South African team has been announced for the CAA Southern Region Cross Country Championships in Vacoas, Mauritius on February 24. The young team consists of four junior men and four junior women, featuring some of the country's most promising distance runners. Cherise Sims, the only senior athlete in the team, was included in the final squad after appealing to Athletics SA (ASA) for another opportunity to qualify for the CAA African Cross Country Championships in Chlef, Algeria on March 17. "Good luck to this largely young team. We trust they will carry the national flag with pride as they represent our country against our Southern African neighbours," said ASA president, Aleck Skhosana. "We believe this experience will assist them in their development and help them prepare for next year's IAAF World Cross Country Championships, as part of the federation's long-term vision to achieve international success at major events across all disciplines."
