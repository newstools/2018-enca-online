MANCHESTER – Paul Pogba was recalled into the Manchester United side to face Chelsea by Jose Mourinho on Sunday in a crunch Premier League clash in the battle for a top-four finish. Pogba, who cost United a then world record £89 million ($124 million) from Juventus in 2016, hasn't completed 90 minutes for over a month and was dropped to the bench for Wednesday's 0-0 draw at Sevilla in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie. Today's #MUFC starting XI - and it looks like 4-3-3 for the Reds!

Mourinho praised Pogba's professionalism in handling his benching, but has been withering of his performances in recent weeks.
