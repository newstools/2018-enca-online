JOHANNESBURG - Lawyers representing the families of those who died in the Life Esidimeni tragedy presented their closing arguments before the arbitration hearings. On Thursday, the State, Solidarity and Section27 agreed that the families of the mentally-ill patients who died should be compensated. They've been offered R200,000 which will cover funeral costs, as well as claims for emotional shock. READ: Esidimeni families seek R1.5-million in damages This still needs to be reviewed by the arbitration hearings chairperson, retired deputy chief justice Dikgang Moseneke. Over 140 patients died in Gauteng after they were moved to ill-equipped NGOs. Section27 also wants R1.5-million for constitutional damages. eNCA
