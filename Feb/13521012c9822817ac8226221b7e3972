JOHANNESBURG - Top officials in South Africa's ruling ANC party are divided over whether President Jacob Zuma should step down, the party's deputy secretary-general said on Tuesday. "The NWC (national working committee) has discussed the issue surrounding the future of President Jacob Zuma," Jessie Duarte told reporters after the committee met on Monday. "I can say to you that there are different views, there was a dominant view at the NWC, but it wasn't the only view." The outcome of the recent NWC meeting has not been made public. Duarte confirmed that Thabiso Setona, an ANC member, has been arrested for assaulting a woman. He was caught on camera kicking the woman during a march in Johannesburg on Tuesday. - Additional reporting Reuters eNCA
