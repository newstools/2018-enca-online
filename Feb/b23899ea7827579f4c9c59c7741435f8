JOHANNESBURG - Time is money, but not all of your working time is your own. Tax, a much-detested but unavoidable necessity, means a chunk of your salary, and therefore your time, belongs to the government. With a budget deficit of over R50-billion, many expect some form of tax increase, whether on business, personal or VAT, when finance minister Malusi Gigaba announces the budget on Wednesday evening. WATCH: What to expect of Budget 2018 How exactly is your tax money being spent on though, and how much of your working day belongs to the government, before you start working for yourself? The TaxClock, a tool developed by Code for South Africa, breaks down this information. You simply enter your salary, and it will calculate how much time you spend helping to work off the national debt or how many minutes you work to contribute towards education or health. The clock will be updated to reflect the latest information once the finance minister has delivered his 2018 budget speech. eNCA
