CAPE TOWN - Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille has survived a no-confidence vote on Thursday. She stands accused of mismanaging her office. While de Lille survived, by one vote, her troubles may be far from over as the Democratic Alliance (DA) goes after her. There is speculation that it is only a matter of time before she is shown the door as the DA’s Federal Executive is still probing her. The mayor has said that she is not married to the party and simply wants her reputation and name cleared in this ongoing struggle between her and the party. The official opposition in the city, the ANC, said the DA did not care about women of colour in the party. ANC's Xolani Sotashe says the DA likes to undermine black women. They say tactics is the art of politics #DeLille pic.twitter.com/MtMsyGOzeJ Breaking: #DeLille survives motion of no confidence by a difference of one vote Thank you to the councillors for their support. You showed your courage and conviction. Let’s get back to our work! pic.twitter.com/OWo27Mih43 The Western Cape High Court on Wednesday ruled that members of the City of Cape Town caucus can vote in secret if the speaker allows. De Lille went to court this week after the DA's Federal Executive told councillors to tow the party line and vote against her.
