LONDON – Watford striker Troy Deeney has escaped disciplinary action over his goal celebration in a shock 4-1 win over Chelsea on Monday after officials failed to agree on whether he had committed a red card offence. Deeney opened the scoring from the penalty spot shortly before half-time and then appeared to make an offensive gesture towards a section of the Vicarage Road crowd. A three-man panel convened by England's governing Football Association (FA) could not agree on whether his action merited a retrospective red card, so Deeney, who has already served three and four-match bans this season, merely faces the prospect of receiving a written warning regarding his future conduct.
