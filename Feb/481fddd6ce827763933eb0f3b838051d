PRETORIA - Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga joined law enforcement agencies in raiding suspected drug dens in the city on Thursday. South African Revenue Servcices (Sars) and Home Affairs officials also took part in the Pretoria West raids. Officials seized contraband found at a house, although the occupants were not home at the time. Msimanga says raids will continue throughout 2018. “We should drive those who are peddling illegal things out of our city,” he said. “There should never be any space for them to operate [here]. So, we are starting here today and we should continue throughout the year until this city of ours is rid of drug dealers, prostitution and issues of illegal businesses that are mushrooming all over.” eNCA
