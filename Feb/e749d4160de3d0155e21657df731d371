JOHANNESBURG - Parliament is holding public hearings on a bill to replace the National Key Points Act. The Right 2 Know campaign says the new bill is similar to 'Apartheid-era' laws. The organisation’s Murray Hunter said: “There is very good cause to be reworking this legislation or scrapping it and that's because we've got an apartheid-era secrecy law on our books, which is being implemented on daily basis. There are very few people who are openly arguing to keep the Act on the books." READ: Key points list made public Hunter says while there has been a degree of good faith in undertaking the reform of the old legislation, there are concerns this could be an “ugly cousin”. Under current laws, national key points are protected from being photographed or identified. National key points are understood to include military installations and services or factories which are considered strategic. Parliament, the Union Buildings and even the South African Broadcasting Corporation are among the list of current national key points in South Africa. eNCA
