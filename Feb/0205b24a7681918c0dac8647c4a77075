JOHANNESBURG - ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule on Tuesday announced the recall of President Jacob Zuma due, in part, to the "period of uncertainty and anxiety as a result of the unresolved matter of transition". Magashule presented a statement from the ANC national executive committee (NEC) on the outcome of the special meeting that took place on Monday and into the early hours of Tuesday. The NEC decided to recall Zuma after Magashule and ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa returned to the NEC from a late-night visit to Zuma at his nearby home.
