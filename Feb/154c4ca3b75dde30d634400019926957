JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance is calling for the immediate removal of Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane following the North Gauteng High Court's decision to set aside the Bankorp/CIEX report with costs. The court has ordered Mkhwebane to personally pay 15 percent of the costs and the other 85 percent be paid by her office. READ: Mkhwebane's Absa report set aside with costs DA MP Glynnis Breytenbach says this is not the first time the Public Protector has wasted state resources on frivolous court applications. Breytenbach says that since Mkhwebane took office she has "wastefully" incurred legal costs including: "By all accounts, Mkhwebane is utterly ineffectual and dangerously out of touch with her mandate as Public Protector," says Breytenbach. Mkhwebane's report, released in June, ordered Absa to pay more than R1-billion for an apartheid-era bailout provided to its predecessor, Bankorp, by the SA Reserve Bank. eNCA
