JOHANNESBURG – Gauteng Transport MEC Ismail Vadi on Wednesday launched a new Gautrain website and mobile application at the Technology Innovation Conference 2018 at the Gallagher Conference Centre in northern Johannesburg. The new website and app will allow passengers to create a profile where they will easily manage their ticketing online by linking many cards to their online profile, check expiry dates and even block cards online. “This is one of the many system enhancements that have been implemented on the Gautrain since the start of operations to ensure that the Gautrain is quick, convenient and efficient,” the MEC said.
