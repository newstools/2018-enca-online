JOHANNESBURG - ANC Deputy President and Mpumalanga Premier, David Mabuza has been served with a temporary protection order. It orders him to stop harassing and intimidating Mpumalanga businessman, Frederick Coenraad Daniel. Daniel accuses Mabuza of orchestrating attacks on his business to force him off his land. He says Mabuza has targeted him because he’s exposed corruption in the province. The Premier’s spokesperson says Mabuza rejects the allegations, and plans to challenge the protection order in court. eNCA
