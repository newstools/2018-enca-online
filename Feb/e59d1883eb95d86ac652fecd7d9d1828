JOHANNESBURG - Opposition parties are to meet on Friday to discuss how to respond to the announcement that President Jacob Zuma will deliver the State of the Nation address on Thursday next week. The DA had called for a postponement of the address until Zuma is replaced, while the EFF has called for a motion of no confidence in Zuma to be held before SONA. But Parliament's presiding officers said on Thursday there was no valid reason to convene a special sitting ahead of the address. UDM leader Bantu Holomisa says he fully concurs with the EFF call. He has invited opposition parties to meet on Friday to discuss their response. The EFF's Dali Mpofu said no opposition could allow Zuma to address the nation.

"Why must we humiliate South Africans by making them listen to someone who's facing criminal charges. We will not allow that, it’s not going to happen,” he said. The ANC's top six apparently have until Sunday to take a decision on Zuma. They have been mandated to manage the transition from his rule to that of new party president Cyril Ramaphosa. eNCA
