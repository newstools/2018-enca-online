BEIJING, China - The African Union's chairman dismissed a French newspaper report alleging that China had spied on the continental body, as "lies" intended to derail cooperation. The report published by Le Monde in January claimed technicians at the AU's Chinese-built headquarters in the Ethiopian capital discovered last year that the contents of their computers had been regularly copied to servers in Shanghai since 2012, citing unnamed AU sources.

Standing next to Wang, he told reporters that the allegations were "all lies," adding that no story "can distract us or divert us from our relations." The AU is not dealing with "secrets or defence", he said, and "I don't see how it is in the interest of China to offer such a building and spy." For his part, Wang said the AU conference centre is "a symbol of Chinese-African friendship" and that China had "selflessly" built the building.

Le Monde said the AU's servers were changed and its IT systems redone after the copying was found. The newspaper also reported that Ethiopian cyber security experts removed microphones hidden in the desks and walls of the headquarters. China is deeply invested in Africa, regularly offering low-interest loans and gifts to individual nations and doing $149.2-billion (R1.7-trillion) in trade with the continent in 2016. AFP
