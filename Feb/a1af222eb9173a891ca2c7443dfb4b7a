CAPE TOWN - South Africa's mining industry should speed up transformation in the sector to let more black players in, or face pressure from the population, deputy mineral resources minister Godfrey Oliphant warned on Thursday. "The message to the mining industry is that... the time for transformation in a meaningful way is actually now," Oliphant said on the last day of the industry's annual "mining indaba" in Cape Town. "If we donâ€™t rise up to the challenges of transformation we might be put under pressure by society to do things which we might regret," he added. #MiningIndaba Oliphant urges mining industry to "shape up" or the ANC might be forced to back to conversations the industry doesn't want (nationalisation). #MiningIndaba Oliphant says BEE shareholders in mines still have more debt than equity. Been resistance to transformation, was never going to be easy. Oliphant said he met with the Chamber of Mines last week, to discuss ongoing concerns around the controversial mining charter. #MiningIndaba Deputy Minister of Mineral Resources Godfrey Oliphant says laws in SA aren't done "out of spite". Want everyone to benefit from the mineral wealth. African News Agency
