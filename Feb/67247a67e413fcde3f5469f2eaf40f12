JOHANNESBURG - Former acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane is expected to hand himself over to the authorities on Thursday. He’s expected to face corruption and money-laundering charges in the Specialised Commercial Crimes court. In December, police raided seven properties linked to Phahlane, his wife and police contractor Keith Keating. It’s alleged that Keating’s company, Forensic Data Analysts, received R5-billion in contracts since 2010. The Ipid alleges that Keating paid for vehicles for Phahlane and his family.  eNCA
