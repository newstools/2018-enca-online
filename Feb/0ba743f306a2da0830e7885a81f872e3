JOHANNESBURG - Future Park has arrived in Johannesburg after a successful run in Cape Town. Drawings created by participants come alive in a unique digital universe. The show is the brainchild of TeamLab, a group of University of Tokyo graduates. It's fully interactive. Users can create their own dreamscapes, move them about, dissolve them. Theyâ€™re limited only by their own imagination. The exhibition is underway at the Silver Star Casino in Gauteng and continues till early April. * Watch the full video report by Ditiro Selepe in the galley above. eNCA
