PRETORIA – It’s been 27 years since they first started making music, but metal band Incubus show no signs of slowing down. The group is currently in South Africa, as part of the world tour to promote its eighth full-length studio album, aptly named 8. Saturday night’s show at the Voortrekker Monument in Pretoria was a near-rapturous experience for fans. Thank you #Pretoria -------- pic.twitter.com/8shVp13Rtw The show was an even mix of tracks from the new album, and fan-favourites like “Drive”, “Anna Molly”, “Nice to Know You” and “Warning”. A cover of INXS’ “Need You Tonight” was exquisitely rendered, and it was easy to imagine Incubus frontman Brandon Boyd as the late Michael Hutchins. Boyd is mesmerising on stage, not just because his vocals are powerful, but his swaying movements embody the emotive lyrics, his hands held out in supplication.

Watch the video above. Incubus will perform in Cape Town on Wednesday, supported by Southern Wild, Retro Dizzy and BRYNN. eNCA
