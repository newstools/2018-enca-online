JOHANNESBURG - South African comedian Trevor Noah, who hosts Comedy Central's The Daily Show, cracked an invite from talk show queen Oprah Winfrey. Noah was interviewed on Oprah's SuperSoul Conversations in front of a live audience at New York's legendary Apollo Theatre. My man: All I need is for Trevor and many young Zim and African celebrities to endorse my presidential candidacy.... https://t.co/MsVpBhZT6M Oprah discussed Noah's memoir, Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood, as well as the current political climate in the United States. They discussed both having grown up using an outhouse. She said, “You never get over that smell.” Noah recounted a rumour from his childhood that a child had fallen into the pit toilet. “I was sure that had happened!” he said, pointing out that his grandmother still lives in the house he was brought up in, and still uses the outhouse, although it now has modern plumbing.
