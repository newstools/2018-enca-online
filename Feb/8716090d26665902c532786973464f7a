CAPE TOWN - The reconstruction work to rehabilitate the seawall and repair storm damage along the Sea Point Promenade and at the Sea Point Pavillion swimming pool is progressing well, the City of Cape Town said on Tuesday. “(The) city’s transport and urban development authority (TDA) is continuing with construction work along the Sea Point Promenade between Rocklands Beach and Three Anchor Bay. Once completed, residents and visitors to Cape Town will fully enjoy the benefits of this nine-year-long project that covers the rehabilitation of the promenade along Granger Bay, Mouille Point and Sea Point,” said Brett Herron, mayoral committee member for transport and urban development.
