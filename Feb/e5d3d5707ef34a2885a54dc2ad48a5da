They were shot and killed on Wednesday. WATCH: eNgcobo church owner speaks out Banele Mancoba admits his brother, Thandazile, was involved in a gang. Police say the church is now a crime scene and faces closure. But Mancoba is adamant that God will not allow "his home to be demolished". "We will listen to God [to tell us] what we must do. God is in control of everything," he said. Complaint lodged but ignored The South African Council of Churches says it lodged a complaint with government, over the Seven Angels Church, but was ignored. The council’s Bishop Abednigo Zamindawo Qgira said: "We went to the magistrate’s office with the community. I was the one talking on behalf of the SA council of Churches and I said, we'd be pleased if this church can be closed.  We said to government we are giving them at least seven days to respond, they didn't come back to us and we have a feeling if they responded, this wouldn’t have happened.” eNCA
