CAPE TOWN - Economic Freedom Fighters leader  Julius Malema says that if National Assembly Speaker Baleke Mbete does not respond to the party’s motion of no confidence letter, it will go to court. “The motion of no confidence [in President Jacob Zuma] must take place this week and Baleke has not responded to the EFF letter about bringing forward the motion of no confidence," says Malema.

In a statement released on Monday, Mbete said she was currently consulting on the EFF’s request to change the date of its no-confidence debate. The motion is scheduled to be heard on 22 February, but the EFF wants it brought forward to Tuesday. Parliament has refuted claims that Mbete has already rejected the EFF’s request. eNCA
