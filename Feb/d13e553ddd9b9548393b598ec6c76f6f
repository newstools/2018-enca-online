PARIS - French fashion brand Courreges said Wednesday the German designer Yolanda Zobel would be taking the reins of the label known for its 1960s futurist look. Courreges has been without an artistic director since the departure of Sebastien Meyer and Arnaud Vaillant seven months ago. Zobel, who cut her teeth at Armani, Chloe, Acne Studios and Jil Sander, immediately set down a marker, saying the brand would return to it mould-breaking roots. "This new Courreges will grow from the urge of creating a whole new universe for a free human -- ahead of its time, explorative, courageous, self-aware... engaged and yet able to indulge in liberating moments of fun," she said in a statement. The brand's owners, French advertising executives Jacques Bungert and Frederic Torloting, said they were convinced that Zobel "will be able to grasp what Courreges is all about while remaining true to herself." The label, founded in 1961 by engineer Andre Courreges and his wife Jacqueline, known as Coqueline, became a symbol of 1960s rebellion and invention. AFP
