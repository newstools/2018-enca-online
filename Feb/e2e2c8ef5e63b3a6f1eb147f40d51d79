JOHANNESBURG - The probe into state capture is gaining momentum. The Hawks have confirmed they've served a subpoena on Eskom to force the power utility to hand over documents linked to the state capture investigation. Eskom says it's cooperating fully, but says it’s found evidence that some documents may have been shredded. The Hawks say if evidence has been shredded, it’s defeating the ends of justice.
