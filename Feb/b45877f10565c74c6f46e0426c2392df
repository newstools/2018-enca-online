The right-hander was unbeaten on 143 (285 balls, 15 fours, one six) at the close with the reigning champions on 307/7 after winning the toss and batting.

Theunis de Bruyn (29), Werner Coetsee (26), Keegan Petersen (24) and Patrick Kruger (21) also did the early work, before throwing it away as the Titans ensured they were not too far behind in the game. Rowan Richards (3/53) and Shaun von Berg (3/74) were the best of the bowlers, but both failed to breach the defences of Mokoena as the Knights ensured they were just ahead. African News Agency
