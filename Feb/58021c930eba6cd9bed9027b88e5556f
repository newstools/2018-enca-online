This makes the Chinese tech giant the first mobile device manufacturer in the world to do this. READ: Self-driving shuttle collision mars Las Vegas debut It has named the project the Road-Reader. The project pushes the boundaries of Huawei’s object recognition technology. "So there is AI running on the phone. It has been trained to identify about a thousand objects and because it's AI it can learn new objects as well. When it recognises the object the camera is scanning the road conditions. The phone understands what is on the road and what that element is and it can react differently to whatever is in its way," said Huawei's head of handset portfolio. eNCA
