PYEONGCHANG – An intrepid squirrel came within a whisker of meeting a sticky end Saturday when it scampered across the snowboard parallel giant slalom course during a race. Harbouring an apparent death wish, the furry intruder skipped under the board of Daniela Ulbing when she was in full flight, but the Austrian recovered deftly to beat Russian Milena Bykova and reach the quarter-finals. Give that squirrel a medal for courage. @Olympics pic.twitter.com/XndWq8l8zs "I saw it coming from the right side and it was so close to my board," said Ulbing, who survived her brush with the squirrel but failed to beat gold medallist Ester Ledecka in her next run.
