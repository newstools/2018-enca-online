JOHANNESBURG - Kaizer Chiefs are ready to take on Orlando Pirates in the Soweto Derby at the FNB Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm) having won six and drawn four of their last 10 matches. “We have a big week ahead of us,” Coach Steve Komphela admitted. “The Soweto Derby will be a defining game. I hope that we will come out as lions and tigers. I foresee sparks and will be a great match to watch.” However, despite Chiefs' unbeaten run there was a feeling of having missed out on the three points against Bloemfontein Celtic on Saturday evening. “We had so many attempts on goal,” said Komphela rued after the goalless draw, “we should have scored at least one. You live to regret a night like this.” READ: Amakhosi waste chance to make up ground on Sundowns Chiefs had a good game, pushing Celtic all the way, but they failed to find the back of the net. “We could have closed the gap to Sundowns,” said Komphela, referring to Mamelodi Sundowns 1-1 draw with SuperSport United, a game that finished just before the kick-off of Amakhosi’s clash. “We discussed the result at halftime, just to highlight the need to get the three points.” A Kaizer Chiefs win agaisnt Celtic would have closed the point gap between log leaders Mamelodi Sundown and Amakhosi to just three points. But it wasn’t to be, despite the opportunities the Glamour Boys had to score. Amakhosi are, however, still in second spot on the Absa Premiership table. Komphela did add that despite “getting numerous chances, only a few were clear cut”. “We need to draw lessons from this loss of two points,” the Chiefs mentor explained, “and try to get a bounce-back factor.” African News Agency
