JOHANNESBURG - The Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) closed lower on Monday in subdued trade‚ with industrial stocks and retailers paring gains made last week. Market sentiment was subdued following the surge by the local bourse last week‚ which yielded the JSE’s best one-week performance in more than two years. The fact that US and Chinese markets were shut on Monday also reduced liquidity‚ with volumes on the JSE at R12.8bn‚ compared to the usual daily average of R20bn. Industrials and gold miners fared worst‚ the former weighed down by Naspers‚ which fell despite a solid performance by Hong Kong associate Tencent on Friday. A firmer rand also put banks and retailers under pressure. READ: Rand slips a little as market eyes budget The all share lost 0.71% to 58‚701.4 points and the top 40 0.75%.

He should use this support to go for some early wins‚ such as the arrest of people closely connected with alleged corruption‚ de-regulation of the retail sector and a review of labour law to encourage more mechanisation in the mining sector‚” Elliott said.
