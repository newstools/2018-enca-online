JOHANNESBURG - KSW, one of Europe’s leading Mixed Martial Arts promotions has exclusively revealed to eNCA that South Africa’s biggest MMA star, Dricus du Plessis (11-1) will be fighting Roberto Soldić (13-2) for the Croatian’s Welterweight title in April. In a twist of irony, it is the same belt that Soldić took from the previous incumbent, Borys Mańkowski, last December, when he stepped-in as a late-replacement for an injured Du Plessis. Speaking to The Clinch on Friday morning, du Plessis said: “It’s finally time for me to show the people that I’m the real champion. Soldić got lucky, he fought a half-assed Borys to win that belt. The thing about Soldić is that he fights the same way, every time. The guy’s a one-trick pony and he’s just fought cans. In April, the world will witness the real KSW Welterweight champ and that’s Dricus ‘Stillknocks’ du Plessis.” It is certainly an interesting match-up, particularly with du Plessis’s orthodox kick-boxing dealing, with a southpaw knock-out artist in Soldić. Eleven out of the Zagreb man’s 13 victories have come by way of knock-out and his only two losses were by decision. His cardio is certainly a match for the South African, but it is on the canvas where du Plessis should be the most comfortable. All but one of his last seven victories have been quality submissions over top international opponents, particularly BAMMA champ and BJJ Black Belt Yannick Bahati and the Polish Beserker, Rafal Haratyk. Certainly, if du Plessis wins in the ancient Silesian capital of Wrocław to become the holder of three global golden buckles, it would be a massive achievement for African MMA to crow at. KSW 43 takes place on 14 April and will be available, globally, on www.KSWTV.com. eNCA
