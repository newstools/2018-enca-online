JOHANNESBURG - Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane's decision to use popular township phrase eita daar as an opening line of his critique of the State of the National Address (Sona) speech has made him a laughing stock on social media. Newly-elected President Cyril Ramaphosa on Friday delivered his inaugural Sona address. Social media, never ceasing the opportunity throw shade, created a hilarious spoof to mock the DA leader. The video shows a Maimane impersonator behind the scenes while preparing for the recording of his speech. It had Twitter users in stitches.
