JOHANNESBURG - Key discussions between SA Rugby and SuperSport have resulted in SuperSport agreeing to waive radio broadcast rights fees for Vodacom Super Rugby for the SABC.
	
	This follows the national broadcaster’s statement that it has financial challenges regarding the rights of Vodacom Super Rugby and is unlikely to produce live radio broadcasts of the tournament.
	
	Mark Alexander, President of SA Rugby, emphasised that radio plays a critical role in informing rugby followers and duly asked for SuperSport’s support in this regard.

	“We know and understand the realities of South Africa. Once Alexander asked, we were happy to come to an arrangement.”
	
	Alexander said, “On behalf of all our rugby followers and SA Rugby, I’d like to thank SuperSport for this significant gesture.
	
	“They have worked with us and the SABC to find a solution to keep rugby on the radio airwaves and the waiving of the rights fee to which they are entitled is a significant step in that process.

	“I trust that the SABC will now be able to reassure listeners that rugby commentary on Vodacom Super Rugby, Currie Cup and Springbok Test matches will be a feature of their 2018 schedules.” eNCA
