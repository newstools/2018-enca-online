JOHANNESBURG - At least two Eastern Cape cinemas have cancelled the scheduled screening of the controversial fim, Inxeba (The Wound) following threats of shutdown from traditional chiefs and some social media users. The Nu Metro Walmer Park in Port Elizabeth said it would not proceed with the screeening of the movie due to protest action against the movie. East London's Hemingways Mall also cancelled the opening of the movie. "Dear Shopper. We have just received word from Tsogo Sun that the movie "Inxeba - The Wound" showing has been suspended, and will not be running today as previously advertised. Kind regards, Centre Management," the mall said on Facebook.

The film also bagged seven Annual South African Film and Television Awards nominees on Friday including best actor for lead character played by Nakhane Toure. Toure had received numerous threats after the release of the film but it seems the attention has now turned to cinemas. Inxeba tells a story of a young gay man played by Toure who goes to the Eastern Cape to join a group of other men to be a traditional sergeon to initiates and one of the young initiates discovers the man's secret (homosexuality). Social media users shared their mixed views ahead of the screening of Inxeba on Friday. Watch the trailer of the much talked-about movie below: eNCA
