MADRID - Manchester United striker Alexis Sanchez has struck a deal with Spanish authorities to accept a 16-month suspended jail sentence for tax fraud in return for avoiding a trial. Sanchez, who joined United from Arsenal last month, faced being tried over a one-million-euro (R14.7-million) fraud linked to image rights in 2012 and 2013 during his time at Spanish giants Barcelona, according to details of the deal.
