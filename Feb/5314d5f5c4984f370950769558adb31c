JOHANNESBURG - The United States government on Friday said it would like to express condolences on the passing of Zimbabwe's former prime minister and popular opposition MDC-T leader Morgan Tsvangirai. "Our hearts, thoughts and prayers go out to his family and to all the people of Zimbabwe," said the US Department of State French Language Spokesperson Brian Neubert, who is based in Johannesburg. Tsvangirai lost his battle with colon cancer at a Johannesburg hospital on Wednesday night. He was 65.

Tsvangirai formed the opposition MDC in 1999, which has led the charge for democracy in Zimbabwe, which until last year had been under the iron fist rule of Robert Mugabe. The dictator was ousted from power in December after 37 years. Mugabe left the once thriving country's economy in a near-comatose state. For years Tsvangirai fought the injustices and excesses of the ruthless Mugabe regime.
