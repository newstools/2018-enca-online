JOHANNESBURG - Six suspects implicated in a string of killings in Marikana last year made their first court appearance in Brits in North West on Monday. Arrested at the weekend, they are linked to the killing of at least nine members of the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) union. Supporters of Amcu protested outside the Brits Magistrate's Court. WATCH: 'Brains' behind the Amcu killings arrested, says Mbalula Alfred Makhaye, an Amcu spokesman, said the suspects were not members of the union. He said they had blamed the killings on internal union clashes, but "they were lying". "We don’t want them to be given bail at all, they were trying to paint Amcu in a bad light." Three other suspects linked to the killings in Marikana were arrested last year. Police Ministry spokesman Vuyo Mhaga said the men who appeared on Monday were the masterminds of the killings.

They told the magistrate they would hire their own private lawyers to represent them in the matter. When the state asked for the matter to be postponed to 21 February, the men seemingly took issue with such a delay. Some of them suggested the matter be scheduled for this week, citing their personal circumstances. But the magistrate reminded the men of the seriousness of the charges against them, putting the matter down for next week to allow for further investigations. eNCA
