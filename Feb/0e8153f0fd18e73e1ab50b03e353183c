JOHANNESBURG - Regulations that determine the powers of Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo in the state capture inquiry were published on Friday afternoon. The regulations set out the powers of the Deputy Chief Justice heading the inquiry, saying he can subpoena people and force people to testify. Zondo can also get subpoenas for certain information that he may need, like bank and phone records. In the public protector's state of capture report, she said that whoever undertook this inquiry into state capture must have the same powers as the public protector. The terms of reference are being seen as empowering the inquiry who won't be limited to just investigating, and comes on the back of what appears to be a tussle between the Zondo and government authorities over what his powers would be. 41436 9-2 JusticeConDev by eNCA.com on Scribd READ: State capture inquiry pointless without Zuma: Madonsela The regulations were published in the government gazette Friday afternoon. “The regulations provide the legal machinery that enables the deputy chief justice to obtain the resources and infrastructure he requires for the commission to perform its function,” according to a statement by the Minister of Justice and Correctional Services Michael Masutha.
