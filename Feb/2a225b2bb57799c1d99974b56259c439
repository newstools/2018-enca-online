JOHANNESBURG – It would appear that former president Jacob Zuma has not only fallen out of favour with the governing party. Zuma on Wednesday announced his resignation, ending days of speculation about his future as president. When eNCA’s Nickolaus Bauer took to the streets, on live TV, asking young people in Braamfontein about their thoughts on the matter - he got more than what he had bargained for. One woman went as far as calling the former state head a motherf****r. “I don’t know… he is a mother f***r, he must just go,” the woman said during the live crossing. A stunned Bauer, attempting to quickly move to the next person for comment, again got a surprise with a young man proceeding to answer the same question by uttering: “F***k him.” eNCA
