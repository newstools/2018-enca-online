JOHANNESBURG - She has not released any new music since the 2010 album, Soldier of Love, but Nigerian-British singer Sade is finally putting out something original. Film director Ava DuVernay confirmed in a tweet, that Sade will be contributing a song to the soundtrack of the upcoming film, A Wrinkle in Time. I never thought she’d say yes, but asked anyway. She was kind + giving. A goddess. We began a journey together that I’ll never forget. Proud to announce that Sade has created an original song for WRINKLE IN TIME. It’s entitled “Flower of the Universe.” And it’s a dream come true. pic.twitter.com/FdXrZ1MFMO The song is called "Flower of the Universe". Other artists who will feature on the soundtrack include Sia, Demi Lovato (with DJ Khaled), and Kehlani. Last but not least, I am in love with the music of a young woman hailing from Oakland. Her vibe. Her voice. Her vision for herself. It’s all beautiful. Kehlani’s original song “Let Me Live” is the first heard while watching WRINKLE IN TIME. It’s all about Meg’s inner life. A gem. pic.twitter.com/Slc3yuIyWQ A Wrinkle in Time is based on the best-selling children's science fantasy adventure novel by Madeleine L'Engle. It stars Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Storm Reid. The film premieres on March 9. eNCA
