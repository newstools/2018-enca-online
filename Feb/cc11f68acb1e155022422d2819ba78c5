JOHANNESBURG – The Department of International Relations and Cooperation (Dirco) has written to the government of the United Kingdom (UK) requesting a review on a travel advisory update. The department raised concerns, saying there have been no terrorist attacks in South Africa in recent years. A new sentence was added to the existing advisory, linked to a case that took place in KwaZulu-Natal this month, where two people with dual South African and UK citizenship were kidnapped.

It says the link created by the advisory is viewed as premature. “Isolated threats of terrorism that have been experienced in South Africa have been effectively and promptly dealt with,” Dirco added. eNCA
