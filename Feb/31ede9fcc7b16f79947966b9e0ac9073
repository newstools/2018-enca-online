JOHANNESBURG - Amcu says its members will not return to work until they’re satisfied the mine is complying with all safety regulations. The union says workers should be given time to get counselling.
	
	“We put a demand that there mustn’t be any worker who report for duty on Monday. They need to be given enough time for counselling," says Amcu President, Joseph Mathunjwa.

If Sibanye can purchase a mine in US, surely they can purchase new generators to save lives. We want to check if Sibanye is complying with all the regulations because the regulations say the company should have emergency power supply for ventilation purposes,” says Mathunjwa. On Wednesday, about 955 workers were trapped underground at Beatrix Shaft 3 after a severe storm affected an elevator used to bring them to ground. All miners were rescued on Friday morning unharmed. eNCA
