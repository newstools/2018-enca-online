JOHANNESBURG – The Neslon Mandela Foundation has reiterated it calls for President Jacob Zuma to resign. Zuma’s future has been subject to speculation amid a host of African National Congress (ANC) top structure urgent meetings of late. The foundation says it has been calling for the president’s resignation for over a year now and “have now reached a point where South Africans can no longer wait for him to do so.” “From December we have watched, sometimes in disbelief, as the floodgates of testimony have opened. Hearings, investigations, inquiries, and other forms of disclosure are providing overwhelming evidence that systematic looting by patronage networks linked to President Zuma have betrayed the country Nelson Mandela dreamed of as he took his first steps of freedom twenty-eight years ago,” it said in a statement.

This work will require years of endeavour, and we call on all South Africans to commit to supporting it,” reads the statement. eNCA
