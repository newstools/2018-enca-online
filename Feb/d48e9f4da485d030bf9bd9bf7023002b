MADRID - Stars of Spanish cinema have lashed out at the lack of women in the film industry at the country's equivalent of the Oscars. "We need directors, screenwriters, directors of photography, scripts, technicians, composers -- equal in number to men," said actress Nora Navas, a vice president of the Spanish Film Academy, during the Goyas in Madrid on Saturday.

"We need time to change that, I think the initiative has to come from politics," said Simon (31). Only 27 percent of the nominees for the Goyas were women and female attendees at the ceremony carried bright red fans sporting #MÁSMUJERES (more women) slogans. The comments come a week after the music industry's hottest stars wore white roses to the Grammys in support of gender equality.

The film, which is in English, is set in an English village and tells the story of a widow who decides to rebuild her life by opening a bookstore despite opposition in the local community. The night's other big winner was the film Handia -- a historic drama set in the Basque Country which took home ten awards. AFP
