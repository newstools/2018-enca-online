JOHANNESBURG - Cape Town Mayor Patricia De Lille is accusing the Democratic Alliance of trying to destroy her reputation. She says the allegation that she solicited a R5-million bribe is false. WATCH: Patricia de Lille to be formally charged by DA, not suspended "The DA is hell-bent on destroying my reputation. I want to send a message to them: if you want to do that, you must come with real evidence. I have never asked any person for any money. The DA is hell-bent on tarnishing my name and my reputation," says De Lille. A Vanderbijlpark businessman, Anthony Foul, alleges that De Lille sought money in exchange for her support of his company to supply fire extinguishers to Cape Town informal settlements. eNCA
