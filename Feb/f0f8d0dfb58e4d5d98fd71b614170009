RABAT - Another miner died Thursday in an impoverished Moroccan city shaken by protests over the plight of people scraping a living in abandoned coal pits known as the "mines of death". A second person was seriously injured in the accident in a disused coal mine in the northeastern city of Jerada, a local activist told AFP. The authorities confirmed that a man had died in an abandoned mine in the city. The latest deadly accident brought out thousands of demonstrators who gathered in front of the local police station, Mohamed Bounif, a representative in the area of the Moroccan association for human rights, told AFP. Mass protests against economic marginalisation broke out in the city in December after two brothers died in a tunnel accident. Each day hundreds of people risk their lives to extract coal by hand from the shuttered pits. AFP
