JOHANNESBURG – Military veterans who attended the annual SS Mendi memorial service and wreath-laying ceremony say they wish to see the event attracting more numbers in future. The ceremony took place at Avalon Cemetery in Soweto in southwestern Johannesburg on Saturday afternoon. The service honoured 616 soldiers who lost their lives in 1917, including 607 black soldiers serving in the South African Native Labour Contingent. 2018 marked 101 years since the tragedy when the ship sank in the English Channel. Officials from the City of Johannesburg were there to pay their respect with family members as well as military personnel. Veterans at the event said they hope for larger numbers in future. “We would appreciate it if it can be a bigger event that all our people can come together to say thank you to all the people who died,” one veteran told eNCA. “It’s great to see civilians here as well as men and women in uniform. This is the patriotism we need to grow,” another veteran said.

If there’s only one person, if I’m the only one here, I would still do it because I respect those people,” Godfrey Giles, SA Legion of Military Veterans President said. eNCA
