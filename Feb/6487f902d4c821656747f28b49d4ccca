APE TOWN - Ajax Cape Town head coach Muhsin Ertugral expects a different ball game altogether at Orlando Stadium this weekend in a Nedbank Cup Round of 32 showdown. The Urban Warriors thumped their top-flight counterparts 3-0 in an Absa Premiership clash last week, but Orlando Pirates have an opportunity for swift revenge when they host the Cape side in Soweto on Saturday evening (start at 8.15pm).

I know how difficult it is for opposing teams to play in Soweto. “Micho is a great coach and they are very close to success under his guidance. We know how difficult this game will be. “They will come at us, but I think they’ll be a little bit more cautious this time around,” he concluded. African News Agency
