HARARE ‑ Zimbabwe’s secondary education examinations council (Zimsec) has suspended seven top executives over the bungled handling of a final exam last November.

The court said the examinations board should assess students based on their performance in the first paper of the English examination. In a statement on Thursday night, Zimsec board chair Professor Eddie Mwenje apologised for compromising the “standards, integrity and credibility of our schools examination system” and said a systems audit had already been instituted.
