This was in line with resolutions of successive national conferences in a bid to expand and strengthen the organisation’s capacity to execute the tasks and demands of the current phase of the revolution. “Comrade Fikile Mbalula has served the movement for many years with utmost determination and commitment, having served as both the Secretary-General and President of the ANC Youth League for almost a decade,” ANC Deputy Secretary-General Jessie Duarte said. “He has also served as a member of Cabinet for over a decade, recently serving as Minister of Police. “The ANC is confident of Comrade Mbalula’s leadership at the helm of our elections machinery as we advance towards a landslide victory in the 2019 National Elections.” eNCA
