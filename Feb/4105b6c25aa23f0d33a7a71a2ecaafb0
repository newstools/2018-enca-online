JOHANNESBURG - South Africa’s Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors (IRBA) said on Sunday that following its initial review of Steinhoff’s auditors Deloitte South Africa it would pursue further lines of investigation. WATCH: Two cases of insider trading registered in Steinhoff scandal The IRBA said in December 2017 it would investigate Steinhoff’s auditor following the retail group’s disclosure of accounting irregularities. Steinhoff, whose more than 40 brands include Britain’s Poundland, revealed accounting irregularities in December. The revelations sparked a collapse in the company's share price and triggered the resignation of Steinhoff Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Markus Jooste and others.
