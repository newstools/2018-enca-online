PRETORIA - Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) head Robert McBride has made a u-turn and abandoned his initial plan to make representations as to why he should not be prosecuted for child abuse. McBride appeared briefly in the Pretoria Magistrate's court on Tuesday where he has been charged with child abuse and an alternative charge of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm, after allegedly assaulting a family member in August. Magistrate Ignatius du Preez transferred the matter to the regional court where McBride will stand trial. A member of McBride's family is expected to be a defence witness during the trial. The court heard that she has already submitted her statement.

He was previously released on bail of R10,000, on the condition that he did not contact any of the witnesses, which included various members of his family, who he is now able to see. The charges are related to an incident that allegedly took place while McBride and one of his relatives were driving in a car. The relative claimed he beat and strangled her. According to reports, she said that the alleged assault was not an isolated incident and it "happened all the time". However, McBride has denied the allegations "I admit that I admonished one of my (relatives), whom I love very much," said McBride. He explained that he had become concerned about his relative's school marks and "somewhat rebellious" behaviour, and had admonished her, but never assaulted her. The matter has been postponed to March 20. African News Agency
