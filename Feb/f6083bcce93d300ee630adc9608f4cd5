KHARKIV, Ukraine - Roma full-back Alessandro Florenzi has recovered from illness and will start Wednesday's Champions League last 16, first leg against Shakhtar Donetsk at the Metalist Stadium in Kharkiv. Coach Eusebio Di Francesco has given a Champions League debut to in-form Turkish forward Cengiz Under, who has scored four goals in Roma's last three games. Captain Daniele De Rossi plays alongside Dutchman Kevin Strootman in midfield, with Radja Nainggolan in a more advanced role. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian hosts presented no surprises for Roma as winger Bernard overcame a minor shoulder injury to start on the left as expected. Serhiy Kryvtsov continues his comeback from a knee injury, after returning in the Ukrainian league last week having not played before since September. His centre-back partner Yaroslav Rakitskiy makes his 300th Shakhtar appearance.
