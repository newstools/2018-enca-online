READ: Eskom subpoenaed in State Capture probe amid evidence shredding allegations According to Dirk Hermann of Solidarity: “What we have seen here is unlawful enrichment of an individual and we said that is simply not acceptable. The judgment in the High Court actually paved the way for a criminal action. That specific judgment indicated that there was an unlawful transaction. That judgment also said it was deliberately designed.”
	
	They’re also asking for an investigation into other Eskom officials.
	
	The Hawks are also at the power utility to gather documents in relation to the state capture investigation.
	
	Molefe is appealing the court judgement against him. eNCA
