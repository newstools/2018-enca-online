JOHANNESBURG – A rose been named after former liberation struggle icon and President Nelson Mandela. The rose was named after the icon as part of the year-long celebration of the centenary of Mandela’s birth. Mandela, who passed away on 5 December 2013, would have turned 100 on 18 July 2018. The Nelson Mandela rose was released to launch the Nelson Mandela Foundation’s year-long centenary programme, just a week ahead of Valentine’s Day on 14 February.

Horticulturist Keith Kirsten, who led the rose’s development, said the idea for the plant came to him in 2000, while on a flight to New York when he happened to be sitting next to Achmat Dangor, the then CEO of the Nelson Mandela Foundation. The disease-resilient rose is a tall, orange-vermillion, prolific floribunda which grows to more than a metre in good conditions and is suitable for “any sunny position”, Kirsten said. “I’d like to see us plant lots,” he said. eNCA
