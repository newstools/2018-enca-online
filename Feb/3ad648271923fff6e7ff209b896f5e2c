JOHANNESBURG - Tiyani Mabunda became the second Mamelodi Sundowns player to win the Absa Premiership Goal of the Month award in the 2017/18 season, as local football fans voted his strike against Bloemfontein Celtic as the best goal in December. Mabunda’s goal in Sundowns 4-1 home win over Celtic was voted the best from a shortlist that also included his teammate’s Bangaly Soumahoro’s effort for Sundowns in their away win at Golden Arrows. The former Black Leopards midfielder found the bottom right corner of Celtic’s goalkeeper Patrick Tignyemb with a brilliantly-taken low strike from just outside the 18-yard box.

He wins the fourth Goal of the Month award of the 2017/18 season following Polokwane City teammates’ Rodney Ramagalela and Ndivuwo Ravhuhali’s successes earlier in the season and Kekana in November, in the Absa Premiership’s exciting monthly recognition awards for the best goal of the month that were introduced last season. The winning monthly goal was chosen as the best from the online votes by football supporters and the general public, who picked their favourite goal through the Premier Soccer League website.
