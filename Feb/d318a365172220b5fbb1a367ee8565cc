JOHANNESBURG - While South Africa's wait for President Jacob Zuma to step down, details have emerged of what is holding up the talks between Zuma and the president of the ANC, Cyril Ramaphosa. According to well-placed sources speaking to eNCA's reporter Xoli Mngambi, the issue of Zuma's future legal fees is proving a bone of contention.
