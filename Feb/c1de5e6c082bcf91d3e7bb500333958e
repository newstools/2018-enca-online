JOHANNESBURG - The Gauteng Department of Roads and Transport did not meet a single target in its mandate to create jobs for unemployed people in the province, the DA said on Sunday. For the third quarter of the 2017/2018 financial year, the department was supposed to create 40 job opportunities for youth, 22 for women, and four for people with disabilities in construction, but this did not happen, said DA MPL Fred Nel.

The department was not doing enough to eradicate poverty and to create better opportunities for all." The DA challenged MEC Ismail Vadi to ensure his department meets all the job creation targets set for the 2017/2018 financial year. "The construction programme of the department was critical, given the current state of the roads in the province. The stagnation of job creation meant that roads would not be well maintained," the party said. "The DA believes that it is the responsibility of all the government departments to create job opportunities. Come 2019 when the DA is voted in power we will ensure total change where all Gauteng government departments meet their targets to reduce unemployment," Nel said. eNCA
