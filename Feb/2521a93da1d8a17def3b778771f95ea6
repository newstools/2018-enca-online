JOHANNESBURG - DA leader Mmusi Maimane is calling on the Speaker of the National Assembly, Baleka Mbete, to reschedule an urgent sitting of Parliament, on Tuesday, to allow MPs to debate and vote on the motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma. Mbete has scheduled the motion of no confidence in Zuma for 22 February. Maimane says he has consulted with the leadership of the EFF, which will send a letter to Mbete's office.

We need a swift resolution to this impasse as soon as possible," says Maimane. He called on Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to support the motion and to ensure it is debated without delay. "Ramaphosa is currently the leader of government business in Parliament. It would be remiss of him to neglect his responsibility in this regard and therefore I call on Mr Ramaphosa to support this call, and to ensure that the motion of no confidence is debated without delay," he said. The DA leader said his party rejects any amnesty or special deal for Zuma. "He is not above the law and must still face the 783 criminal charges illegally dropped over a decade ago and which the courts have now revived. Cyril Ramaphosa cannot talk anti-corruption yet broker an amnesty deal for the corrupt in the ANC. Any attempt to do so will be opposed with everything we’ve got. "Jacob Zuma will retire in prison, where he should have been years ago," said Maimane. eNCA
