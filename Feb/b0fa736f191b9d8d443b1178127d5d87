It follows an investigation into the work the company did for Linkway Trading, a project management firm linked to the Gupta-owned Oakbay group, allegedly used to get lucrative tenders. KPMG came under heavy criticism in 2017, for the role it played in the audit of Linkway Trading, which was allegedly used to channel taxpayers’ money to fund a lavish Gupta wedding in 2013. The auditing sector regulator said if found guilty, the KPMG employee could face sanctions in terms of the Auditing Professions Act.
