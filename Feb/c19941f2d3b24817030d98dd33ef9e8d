JOHANNESBURG - South Africa’s most historic and popular Absa Premiership fixture takes centre stage at FNB Stadium this Saturday. This weekend’s Soweto Derby boasts more than just bragging rights for the Soweto giants. It is must-win for both Pirates and Chiefs in order to increase pressure on log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns, who sit pretty atop the table with 40 points. Just a point separates the Sea Robbers and the Amakhosi, who currently sit with 36 and 35 points respectively, with just eight games left in the season. eNCA
