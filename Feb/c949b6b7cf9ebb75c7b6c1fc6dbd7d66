JOHANNESBURG - The rand was on a shaky ground on Tuesday afternoon‚ feeling the squeeze of a stronger dollar‚ which has been volatile since the start of 2018. The rand’s moves were in sync with other emerging-market currencies‚ including the Turkish lira and Indian rupee. The relative strength in the dollar came as United States (US) government bond yields climbed again‚ with the yield on the benchmark treasury paper touching its highest level in four years‚ at 2.90%.

Moody’s‚ which is the only major ratings agency that has South Africa’s credit rating at investment grade‚ is set to deliver its ratings review within days after the budget.
