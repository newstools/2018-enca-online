JOHANNESBURG - South Africans will find out on March 15 whether former president Jacob Zuma will be prosecuted. National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams has made a decision on whether corruptions charges against Zuma should be reinstated. Due to the ongoing legal wrangling over the legality of Abrahams' appointment as NPA head, the announcement of the decision has been delayed. Delay in announcement of Zuma prosecution decision caused by ongoing legal battle over ruling invalidating #ShaunAbrahams appointment.
		Because of that ruling, CASAC demanded two weeks notice before Abrahams announced decision on JZ. eNCA
