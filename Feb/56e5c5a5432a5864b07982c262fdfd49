JOHANNESBURG – The Gauteng Department of Education has filed an application for leave to appeal the high court ruling on Hoërskool Overvaal's admissions policy. The department is appealing a ruling in the North Gauteng High Court which prohibited the placement of 55 English-speaking pupils at the Afrikaans high school in Vereeniging. Hoërskool Overvaal in Vereeniging and the Gauteng education department have been embroiled in a court battle, with the school insisting it cannot admit the pupils because it lacks capacity and resources.
