JOHANNESBURG - The South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) has applauded police for the breakthrough that resulted in the fatal shooting of seven suspects and the arrest of 10 others allegedly involved in the attack on the eNgcobo police station in the Eastern Cape this week. “We would want to see the prompt resolution of every murder case reported to police in order to have criminals on their back foot," Sanco national spokesman Jabu Mahlangu said on Saturday. Sanco wished the police officer wounded during the shoot-out with the suspects a speedy recovery. "No hole must be big enough for other suspects that escaped. We urge members of the public to assist police in their follow through operations to ensure that the heartless criminals are also put behind bars."

Earlier, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) said seven suspects allegedly involved in the eNgcobo police station attack were shot dead during a shoot-out with a police special task force on Friday night. Hawks spokesman Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said more than 10 other suspects were arrested while others managed to escape. One police officer was wounded and was recuperating in hospital.
