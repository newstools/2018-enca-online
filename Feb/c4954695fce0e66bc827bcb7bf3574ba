JOHANNESBURG - ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa will no longer participate in the build-up programme for the party's Nelson Mandela centennial hear celebrations on Friday and Saturday, "due to other pressing commitments," the ANC said in a statement on Thursday. No information about the commitments was given. Ramaphosa has been engaged in ongoing talks with President Jacob Zuma, to try and negotiate Zuma's early exit. However, it appears Zuma is digging in his heels. READ: 'I'm not going anywhere': Zuma to top 6 The ANC said Ramaphosa will still address the #Mandela100 rally on Sunday.
