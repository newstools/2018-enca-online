JOHANNESBURG – Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga says several changes will be implemented at Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) colleges. She made the comments during the State of the Nation (SONA) debate in Parliament, Cape Town. The minister says less of a burden should be placed on already overcrowded universities. “TVET colleges may now have to only operate at level five and six,” she said. Motshekga said this would help reduce pressure on universities and provide an exit qualification from TVET colleges.
