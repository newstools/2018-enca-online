NOUAKCHOTT - The African Export-Import Bank said it will invest up to $1.5-billion (R17.6-billion) in fishing, mining and financial projects in Mauritania, as the mineral-rich north African desert nation seeks to diversify its economy. Afreximbank, based in Cairo, was set up by African countries in 1993 to promote and finance trade within the African continent and trade between Africa and other continents.
