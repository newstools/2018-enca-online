WASHINGTON - Twitter reported its first-ever quarterly profit on Thursday, delivering a boost to shares of the social network, which had been lagging for years behind fast-growing rivals. The San Francisco-based messaging service said it earned $91-million (R1.1-billion) in the fourth quarter, the first positive net income since it went public in 2013.

Twitter shares surged nearly 15 percent in pre-market trade on the news. The profitability marks a milestone for Twitter, which has lost money consistently since its public offering, sparking speculation on whether it needed to sell itself to keep operating. Chief executive Jack Dorsey welcomed "a strong finish to the year" and added: "I'm proud of the steady progress we made in 2017, and confident in our path ahead." AFP
