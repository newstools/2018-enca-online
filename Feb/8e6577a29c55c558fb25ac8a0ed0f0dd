CAPE TOWN - A cold front will make landfall in Cape Town on Friday night with most of the rain expected around midnight. Models are indicating between 5 and 10mm of rain in the city with up to 20mm in the mountainous regions.  Although the bulk of the rain will be overnight, light rain can still occur on Saturday morning, especially in the Overberg district. "A front of this size and nature is not the answer to the water crisis," said eNCA meteorologist Anika de Beer. "It will, however, provide respite from the heat, reduce evaporation and allow for rainwater collection in tanks." February is the driest and hottest month in Cape Town and the temperatures will recover quickly after this front. Sunday will be sunny and warm and Capetonians can expect a hot start to the new week.
