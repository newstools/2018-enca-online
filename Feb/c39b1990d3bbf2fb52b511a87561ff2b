JOHANNESBURG - Absa has welcomed the court judgment that sets aside her finding that the bank owed the government more than R1-billion in apartheid-era debt. In a scathing judgment earlier on Friday, the North Gauteng High Court set aside Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane's Bankorp/CIEX report and ordered her to pay 15 percent of the costs of the South African Reserve Bank in her personal capacity. Absa says in a statement that the judgment confirms its position and submissions to the court that Absa does not owe any money to the government because it paid fair value for Bankorp, which was given the bailout by the apartheid government. READ: Mkhwebane's Absa report set aside with costs "The court found that the Public Protector 'did not conduct herself in a manner which should be expected from a person occupying the Office of the Public Protector'," Absa says. "The court found that the remedial actions of the Public Protector 'were a product of a procedurally unfair process and are unlawful' and 'the process was not impartial'," it says. "The Bankorp matter has been the subject of uninformed speculation and false accusations against Absa for a very long time. We hope the decision of the High Court puts the matter to rest." The DA has called for Mwkhwebane to be removed. eNCA
