DHAKA - The International Cricket Council on Tuesday penalised the "below average" pitch in Chittagong after batsmen plundered more than 1,500 runs during last week's Test between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Five centuries and six half-centuries were smashed over five days at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium before the teams accepted a draw in the opening Test of the two-match series. Sri Lanka - who declared at a colossal 713 for nine in their first and only innings - criticised the pitch after the match.

He added that the pitch provided "occasional slow turn for the spinners early on" but did not deteriorate as expected over the course of the Test. That resulted "in a pitch that too heavily favoured the batsmen across the five days," Boon said in an ICC statement issued Tuesday. Cricket's governing body gave one demerit point to the Chittagong pitch, rating it "below average".

Chittagong is the second Bangladeshi venue to be rebuked in just half a year. In September, the ICC rated the outfield of Dhaka's Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium "poor" after the hosts defeated Australia by 20 runs in a Test match. AFP
