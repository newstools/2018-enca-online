LONDON - Royal Dutch Shell's profit after taxation almost tripled to just under $13-billion (R155-billion euros) in 2017, energised by rising oil and gas prices. Net or bottom-line earnings for the full year compared with a figure of $4.6 billion in 2016, the Anglo-Dutch energy giant announced on Thursday. Earnings in the fourth quarter leapt 147 percent to $3.8-billion compared with the same period of 2016. Shell was boosted particularly by a major recovery in crude oil prices, which tends to ramp up revenues and profits for the entire sector. World oil prices leapt by about 15 percent to finish the year at around $60 per barrel, aided by oil cartel Opec's efforts to limit its collective production.

Shell added Thursday that profit adjusted for exceptional items and the changing value of oil and gas inventories surged to $12.1-billion in 2017, from $3.5-billion last time around. Revenues soared by almost a third to $305-billion. The company meanwhile boosted its cash flow in the wake of its 2016 purchase of BG Group. "2017 was a year of strong financial performance for Shell," added chief executive Ben van Beurden.
