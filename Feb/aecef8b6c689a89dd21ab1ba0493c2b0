Eight of the world’s leading athletics nations – USA, Great Britain & Northern Ireland, Poland, China, Germany, France, Jamaica and South Africa – will compete for a $2million (R24m) prize pot over two evening sessions of athletics. The competition format features all field and track events up to and including the 1500m. One man and one woman from each nation will be selected in each event in an all-straight final. To mark 100 years since women were given the right to vote, and as part of the Mayor of London’s #BehindEveryGreatCity campaign, the first edition of the event will see all Nations select a woman as team captain. “This is one of the exciting innovative events we are seeing in our sport and our thanks go to British Athletics and the Mayor of London for creating it and hosting it,” said IAAF President Sebastian Coe. “We have eight lanes, eight top nations, eight teams and a host of world-class athletes lining up in each event to win the trophy and prize pot. This will be a fast-paced and exhilarating experience for athletes and fans.” African News Agency
