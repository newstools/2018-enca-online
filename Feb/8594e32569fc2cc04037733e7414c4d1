JOHANNESBURG– Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane has launched a national petition opposing the VAT increase. Maimane accused the ruling African National Congress (ANC) of continuing with corruption under the guise of new leadership. “Don't ever think that this is a new ANC. It's the same ANC that voted with each other and protected each other,” the DA leader told a crowd in Pretoira. “Now, what is worse is they are legitimising stealing from you - as poor people, as the people of this country - through this VAT hike. Sign the petition. I will send instructions on the march, especially here in Tshwane, to go to Treasury. We will fight against that issue and make sure we reject this VAT hike."

"We reject VAT and this is how we are going to do it. You are not powerless as the people. Just because [Finance Minister Malusi] Gigaba says there's going to be a one percent[age point] hike, it has to come to Parliament.” He urged people, to loud cheers, to tell their MPs to vote against the hike. eNCA
