CAPE TOWN – The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has welcomed and claimed responsibility for former president Jacob Zuma’s resignation, party leader Julius Malema said on Thursday. He said Zuma did not leave voluntary or out of his own conscience but was instead afraid of the humiliation he faced because of the EFF’S motion of no confidence, which Malema said had a 99 percent chance of succeeding. He further accused the new ANC leadership of being “too scared” to tell Zuma why he was fired. In describing Zuma’s departure, Malema said the former president’s “legacy of corruption” is now in the “dustbin of history.” Malema, a former staunch ally responsible for Zuma’s ascent to power, blamed Zuma for a whole host of things from state capture, to Marikana, Life Esidimeni, the Sassa debacle and more. The firebrand politician went on to describe Zuma as a “conman” and “post-colonial disaster” that almost brought the country to its knees. The EFF said it had no faith in the ANC, called for the dissolution of Parliament and fresh elections. Malema said now was the time for more vigilance, even though Zuma has left office. He thanked lawyers for, often, their pro bono work in fighting corruption and also used the opportunity to thank the judiciary and media, and in particular late journalist Mandy Rossouw for exposing the Nkandla debacle. Malema pinned his removal from the ANC on Ramaphosa, Gwede Mantashe and Derek Hanekom – accusing Ramaphosa in particular of trying to impress Zuma during the time of his removal. He says he will never go back to his original political home, the ANC, especially after he was embarrassed and had his property seized, saying all those in the governing party are all part of the “same Whatsapp group”. eNCA
