JOHANNESBURG - The Hawks have arrested Free State Sports MEC Mathabo Leeto and Bloem Water CEO Limakatso Moorosi for fraud and corruption. It comes a day after at least three government officials appeared alongside a number of others in the Bloemfontein Magistrate's Court for fraud related to the Estina Dairy Farm project. READ: SA borders on high alert as Ajay Gupta flees Leeto, who is said to be a frontrunner to replace Ace Magashule as ANC Free State chair, and Moorosi are expected to appear in the Bloemfontein Magistrate's Court on Friday morning. The matter dates back to 2009 when Leeto was the mayor of Matjhabeng Municipality. The charges are linked to irregularities in a tender worth R15-million. Both Leeto and Moorosi reportedly received kickbacks for this. eNCA
