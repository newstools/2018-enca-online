JOHANNESBURG – Johannesburg promoter Rodney Berman has placed an offer on the table for a bout between US-based Chris van Heerden and the dangerous Thulani Mbenge. Nothing ventured, nothing gained, goes the truism, which is why Berman has made a bold bid to sign Van Heerden for a fight against the SA welterweight champion Mbenge. Berman contacted Evander Holyfield’s Real Deal Sports and Entertainment, which signed a deal with Van Heerden last year, with an intriguing offer. Berman pointed out that as Van Heerden hadn’t fought in 15 months, a guaranteed fight was available in South Africa – if he wants it. Van Heerden has turned down such overtures in the past, but the division’s stars are making fights and he is on the outer. He has purportedly had potential fights against Manny Pacquiao and Amir Khan fall through, leaving him in limbo. “Speaking openly, Mbenge will be too much for Van Heerden, but we would be quite willing to discuss his future going forward once he has beaten Van Heerden,” said Berman. Mbenge has a big fight on March 3, but there is a June 23 opening at Emperors Palace that might suit all parties, provided Van Heerden accepts. Mbenge is a rising star in the division with 10 knockouts in a dozen fights. Southpaw Van Heerden has been in the US for the past four years and, in the most notable fight of his career, fought Errol Spence jnr in 2015, succumbing in the eighth round. He rebounded with two wins, the last of them against Sacky Shikukutu on a Golden Gloves promotion in 2016. “This is a genuine offer when there aren’t many going for Chris. If he’s serious about boxing, he ought to consider it,” said Berman. “But I also understand any reluctance about fighting Mbenge, who likely beats him.” African News Agency
