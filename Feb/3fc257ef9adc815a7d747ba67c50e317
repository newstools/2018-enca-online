JOHANNESBURG - Black First Land First (BLF) has come out in support of President Jacob Zuma. This after renewed pressure from opposition parties and some within the ANC for him to step down. Thandiswa Yaphi from BLF said Zuma is under attack from "the white people because he's come to the side of the black people".

At a media briefing on Friday, several lobby groups called for the newly elected ANC leadership not to remove president Zuma before his term ends. "The ANC statements are focussing on the removal on the office and the arrest of president Zuma. We request that this type of media statement must be stopped. We demand the newly elected leader to focus on more pressing issues such as the strengthening the ANC. We are then therefore launching the hands off Zuma campaign," said Bafana Nzuza, Unemployed People’s Trust.
