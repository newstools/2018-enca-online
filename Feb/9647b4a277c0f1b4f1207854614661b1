PORT ELIZABETH - Kagiso Rabada has been fined 15 percent of his match fee and received one demerit point after being found guilty of a Level 1 breach of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel during Tuesday’s ODI against India in Port Elizabeth. The South African fast bowler now has five demerit points on his disciplinary record after receiving three demerit points against Sri Lanka in a One-Day International on 8 February 2017 and one demerit point during the Lord’s Test against England on 7 July 2017.

If Rabada reaches the next threshold of eight or more demerit points within a 24-month period, he will be suspended again from either two Tests; one Test and two ODIs/T20Is; or four ODIs/T20Is, whichever comes first for the player. Tuesday’s incident happened in the eighth over of India’s innings when Rabada, after dismissing Shikhar Dhawan, waved at the departing batsman and also made a comment which could have resulted in a reaction from the batsman.

After the match, Rabada admitted the offence and accepted the sanction proposed by Andy Pycroft of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Match Referees and, as such, there was no need for a formal hearing.
