JOHANNESBURG - Newly-elected South African President, Cyril Ramphosa is expected to deliver his first State of the Nation (Sona) address on Friday evening. Being #ThrowbackThursday and all, eNCA takes you down memory lane and gives you the highlights (and lowlights) of former president Jacob Zuma’s turbulent appearances in Parliament and elsewhere. The laughing interpreter Former President Jacob Zuma often had the country in stiches with his quips. On this occasion, while delivering his reply to the budget vote, not even the sign language interpreter could contain his laughter - on live TV. WATCH: Zuma's stand-up gets interpreter laughing A roasting in Parliament If there was one place the former president probably hated the most, it would be Parliament, where Zuma often got ‘burnt’ by the opposition. WATCH: Highlights of the Zuma roast A tent-ative speech It’s pretty difficult to forget the social media banter of how the then-president had angered his ancestors after a tent-raising speech. The Twitter brigade was even calling for a cleansing ceremony after a violent storm ripped through the tent where Zuma was giving his keynote Reconciliation Day celebrations address in Gopane in the North West. Nkandla apology Zuma’s apology - arguably a #SorryNotOne one - for the millions spent in upgrades to his Nkandla homestead will also go down in history. Look at my dab The former president is not only well-known for his vocals, but for his dancing skills too. In this video, JZ did "the dab" at the ANC’s birthday celebrations. eNCA
