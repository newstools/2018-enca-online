JOHANNESBURG – Eight more former patients from Life Esidimeni who were listed as missing by the Gauteng Health Department have been found, that’s according to DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC Jack Bloom. Bloom said four of the patients were found at the Thuli Home Centre in Orange Farm and two were found at the San Michele Mental Institution in KwaThema. He also said one patient was taken to an unknown institution, according to his nephew, and another was moved by her mother who refuses to say where she is but confirms she is still alive. “The police have now resolved 13 of the 62 missing person cases that I opened with them last month, including one who is deceased for unexplained reasons. “This leaves 49 who still need to be found, 27 of whom do not have ID numbers and seven without full names, so it will be very difficult to trace them. “The best way to find them would be by publicising any photographs that are available, but the Gauteng Health Department has puzzlingly not taken this step.” READ: Heads must roll for Life Esidimeni tragedy: Motsoaledi The Life Esidimeni arbitration hearings concluded last week. At least 144 patients died after the Gauteng Health Department moved them from Life Esidimeni facilities to unlicensed NGOs. The State, Solidarity and Section27 agreed that the families of the mentally-ill patients who died should be compensated. They have been offered R200,000, which will cover funeral costs, as well as claims for emotional shock. This still needs to be reviewed by the arbitration hearings chairperson, retired deputy chief justice Dikgang Moseneke. eNCA
