JOHANNESBURG - Former KwaZulu-Natal Economic Development MEC Mike Mabuyakhulu handed himself over to police on Wednesday. Mabuyakhulu and several others, among them business executives, were arrested on charges of fraud, corruption and theft. The charges relate to the R28-million apparently spent by the provincial government on the North Sea Jazz Festival in 2012. The event never took place.

Mabuyakhulu is part of the ANC's 16-member interim leadership structure in KZN. He was removed from the provincial government in 2016. But, he is no stranger to controversy – a few years ago Mabuyakhulu faced corruption and racketeering charges which were later withdrawn. eNCA
