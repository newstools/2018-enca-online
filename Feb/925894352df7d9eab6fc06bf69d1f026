JOHANNESBURG - Last yearâ€™s runners-up Orlando Pirates were drawn against Cape Town City in the Nedbank Cup last-16 draw at the SuperSport Studios in Randburg on Thursday night. Kaizer Chiefs, who are the most successful club in cup competitions in South Africa, will host National First Division side Stellenbosch FC. Mamelodi Sundowns take on minnows EC Bees, who play in the third division. Sundowns hold the record for the highest scoring victory after they won 24-0 in 2012 against Powerlines FC.
