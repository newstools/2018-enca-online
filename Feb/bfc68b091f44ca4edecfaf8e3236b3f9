LOS ANGELES – Kanye West and Lloyd's of London insurers have resolved a $10 million lawsuit over the rapper's cancellation of his 2016 tour. A California federal court judge on Wednesday dismissed the lawsuit brought by West's Very Good Touring company against syndicates of Lloyd's of London insurance markets after requests by both parties, court documents showed. Paul Schrieffer, the attorney representing Lloyd's, said on Thursday that the dispute "was resolved amicably" but gave no details. West's attorney did not return a request for comment. West sued Lloyd’s for nearly $10 million in insurance payouts after he abruptly canceled his Saint Pablo tour in November 2016 with more than 20 shows left.

The nature of West's medical issues, which followed a week of no-shows, curtailed concerts and on-stage political rants, have never been disclosed. Lloyd's filed a countersuit saying there were "substantial irregularities" in the rapper's medical history and noting that its policies exclude any losses caused by the possession or use of illegal drugs, the impact of prescription drugs not used as prescribed, or the use of alcohol. West has kept a low profile, with few public appearances, since November 2016. He and his wife Kim Kardashian last month announced the arrival of a third child, this time born to a surrogate. Reuters
