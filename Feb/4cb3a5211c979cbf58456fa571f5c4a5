JOHANNESBURG – Jorge Campillo and SA’s Dylan Frittelli will share the lead heading into the final round of the Maybank Championship after another enthralling day at Saujana Golf & Country Club. It has been a tight affair in Kuala Lumpur all week and Saturday proved no different, with 13 different players holding a share of the lead at some point during round three. While those around them jostled for position, playing partners Campillo and Frittelli kept their cool, recording a pair of bogey-free rounds of 66 to get to 15 under. American Berry Henson and Indian Khalin H Joshi were then at 14 under, a shot clear of Nino Bertasio, Phachara Khongwatmai, Hideto Tanihara, Marc Warren, Prayad Marksaeng and Ryo Ishikawa. South African Frittelli has not looked back since winning his first European Tour title at the Lyoness Open in June, adding this season's Mauritius Open to his trophy collection. "It was a good round," he said. "I started off a bit slow but some good birdies during the middle part of the round and that kept me going. "It is super bunched. A lot of Japanese guys up there, a few other Spanish guys, Jorge played great today with me. "I’m excited to mix it up." Campillo has three second-placed finishes since graduating from the Challenge Tour in 2011 but the Spaniard is still searching for that elusive first European Tour win in his 196th event. "It was good," he said. "I played solid for most of the round. I had a few tough holes but I managed to make the putts so overall I played solid. It is a good day. "I’m really looking forward to tomorrow. It is a nice position to be and I’m excited.” African News Agency
