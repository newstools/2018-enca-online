JOHANNESBURG – Another Gupta-owned mine is expected to be hit by protests next week. More than 500 workers are expected to down tools at Koornfontein mine in Mpumalanga over concerns about the non-payment of salaries. The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) says workers’ salaries have not been paid yet, likely due to India’s Bank of Baroda pulling out of the country. WATCH: Workers at Gupta-owned mine on strike over uncertain future Most local banks have already distanced themselves from the controversial family, who are at the centre of state capture claims. Workers at the Gupta-owned Optimum Coal Mine also went on strike this week over the same issue. eNCA
