PRETORIA – The African National Congress (ANC)’s special meeting of the National Executive Committee (NEC) wants the list of zero-rated VAT products expanded, Secretary General Ace Magashule revealed on Sunday. He said the ANC was very concerned about the impact of the VAT hike to 15 percent during Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba’s maiden Budget Speech. Magashule says this move will mitigate the effect of the hike on the poor. Ministerial appointments and government business was not discussed at the Irene gathering outside Pretoria, the secretary general confirmed. "It is the prerogative of the president," Magashule said. The sorting of committees, the deployment of NEC members to provinces, the State of the Nation Address (SONA), Budget Speech as well as the roadmap to the 2019 general elections were discussed. UPDATE: Ramaphosa arrives for ANC NEC meeting Magashule also ended speculation on former KwaZulu-Natal Premier Senzo Mchunu’s future. Mchunu, a backer of President Cyril Ramaphosa, will take a position at Luthuli House in Johannesburg. This brings an end to speculation that Mchunu would receive a post in Ramphosa’s Cabinet. He further revealed that the meeting would be completed later on Sunday and would probably not run into Monday. It was widely expected that the NEC meeting would discuss who should become the country's next deputy president. Political analyst Karima Brown says there has been a lot of speculation about who will take over the role. Brown says that ultimately, the decision on who will become deputy president remains the prerogative of the president.
