JOHANNESBURG - Thousands of students awaiting their grants for 2018 academic year are in limbo as more than 200 workers at the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) have downed tools over higher wages and absorption of contract workers. The strike organised by the National Education Health & Allied Workers' Union (Nehawu) started on Tuesday and continued on Wednesday.

All services of NSFAS have been shut down," said Nehawu spokesperson Khaya Xaba. NSFAS admitted that "normal operations are affected, and that management have, as far possible, made some arrangements to attend to critical operational matters during this time." The workers demands include higher wages, absorption of contract workers to be permanent, implementation of agency fee to non-uniionised workers and subsidised medical aid for parents of NSFAS employees.

This strike has a potential to disrupt the application and allocation of grants thus affecting greatly the higher education sector including TVET colleges," Xaba said. In a statement, NSFAS CEO Steven Zwane said management was working with Nehawu to address their demands. "We assure that we are working with Nehawu and the NSFAS Board to address the issues speedily to ensure that colleagues are back at work, serving the South African public in the implementation of the new fee-free education policy. "We remain committed to the initial agreement with the union to meet on 22 February 2018 to further discuss the outstanding items in order to solicit their commitment before submission can be made to the Board for consideration," he said. eNCA
