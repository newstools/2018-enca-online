SAN FRANCISCO -Â  Alphabet Inc's fourth-quarter profit fell short of Wall Street forecasts as Google's parent company invested heavily on self-driving cars, smartphones and home devices, while its core internet advertising business remained strong. Shares of the company fell 2.7 percent to $1,137( R13,498.12) in after-hours trading on Thursday. Alphabet posted a net loss of $3.02 billion or $4.35 per Class A and B share and Class C capital stock in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared to a profit of $5.33 billion or $7.56 per share a year earlier. Results included a one-time, $9.9-billion charge related to new US tax laws. Excluding one-time items, the company reported earnings of $9.70 per share but missed analysts' average estimate of $9.98 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Alphabet's total spending jumped nearly 27 percent to $24.66 billion. Total revenue rose 24 percent year-over-year to $32.32 billion, led by soaring sales of pricey online ads, an industry dominated by Alphabet and social media giant Facebook. Google sells ad space on YouTube, its search engine and a variety of third-party platforms for anyone to display ads that lead users to watch video, install an app or visit a website. Led by such ads, Google's advertising revenue rose 21.6 percent to $27.23 billion in the fourth quarter. Alphabet on Thursday also named John Hennessy as chair of its board. Reuters
