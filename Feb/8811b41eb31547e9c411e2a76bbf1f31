JOHANNESBURG – The Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) said the ANC’s silence on Multichoice’s decision not to renew ANN7’s contract to broadcast on its platform was “unacceptable”. In a statement released on Sunday, the MKMVA said it has “deliberately held back to speak out immediately.” “This was not because we are not deeply concerned – and in fact outraged – by MultiChoice’s actions, but because we felt it was important that ANC as our mother-body should have taken the lead with an official statement defending the rights of freedom of speech and the right to an expression of a diversity of views,” it said.

Multichoice announced last week that it would not renew ANN7’s contract when it comes to an end in August.

Multichoice has since denied the allegations. MKMVA called on Multichoice to rescind its decision and if MultiChoice does not do so, “we will mobilise our members and all sectors of society to revolt against MultiChoice.” “Such mobilisation should also include the careful consideration of a mass boycott of Dstv and the mass cancellation of Dstv subscriptions,” the MKMVA said. eNCA
