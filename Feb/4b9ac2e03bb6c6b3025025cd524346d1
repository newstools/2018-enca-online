PORT ELIZABETH -  Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Mayor, Athol Trollip posted dashcam footage on social media of rain. The metro sources its water from five dams, all of which are running low. The Municipality has called on residents to decrease daily water usage to just 50 liters per person from 60 liters a day. Besides digging for boreholes, the city stopped pumping water from the Churchill Dam six months ago, keeping it aside as an emergency reserve. eNCA
