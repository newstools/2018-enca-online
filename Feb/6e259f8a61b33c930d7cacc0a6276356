JOHANNESBURG - Mining production growth disappointed in December‚ plunging to 0.1 percent on the previous year, after November’s 6.5 percent and October’s 5.3 percent. This was a far bigger slowdown than anticipated by economists. Investec economist Kamilla Kaplan expected mining to moderate to 5.7 percent, while macroeconomics website Trading Economics projected mining output to ease to 3.4%. Mining appears likely to drag down the fourth quarter’s GDP growth figures‚ which use quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted figures.
