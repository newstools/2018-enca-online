CAPE TOWN - The final between South Africa and India on Saturday evening will decide who the more successful team was over the last two months. The Proteas have not been great with the white ball but believe they have what it takes for one more victory over the visitors. South Africa will be hoping to make it a successful series against the Indians after beating them in the Test series, losing the ODI series, with the T20 series up for grabs.
