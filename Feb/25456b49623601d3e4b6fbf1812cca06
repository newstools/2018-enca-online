JOHANNESBURG - Property group Resilient failed to calm shareholders on Monday following reports of market abuse.
	
	The group confirmed that short-seller Thirty-Six-One ((36One) Asset Management had accused Resilient’s owners and management of inflating share prices with insider transactions. But Resilient says the allegations are unsubstantiated and will not stand up to independent scrutiny.

As the Johannesburg Stock Exchange investigates, Resilient CEO Des de Beer insists the company has done nothing wrong. “Our figures have been examined by all the reputable brokers – Standard Bank, Nedbank etc -- and they considered [them] completely accurate - that’s not the issue. Obviously, the short-sellers think differently, but they are entitled to their view. We know why they have that view. Because they short the share," he said. "We don’t make the shares, the market makes the share. We are as transparent as possible. We’ve spoken to every single asset manager who wanted to speak to us.” He reassured shareholders: "The important thing to remember is that nothing really changes with the business. The share price changes. Our business is very strong. We very sound. We’ve put out forecasts. We not revising forecasts. Fundamentally its business as usual…" De Beer said the market had panicked. 36-One Asset Management was unavailable for an interview with eNCA. eNCA
