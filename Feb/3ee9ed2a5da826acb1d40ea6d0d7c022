ATHENS, Greece - Reigning champions Olympiakos were deducted three points by the Greek Super League on Monday over fan violence that overshadowed their 2-1 loss to AEK Athens earlier this month. The Piraeus club was also fined 90,000 euros ($110,000) and must play its next two home matches behind closed doors, including a derby against bitter rivals Panathinaikos. The loss of points leaves the title-holders seven points adrift of leaders AEK with nine games to play, although PAOK Thessaloniki would move nine points clear of Olympiakos at the top if they beat Larissa later on Monday. Olympiakos are expected to appeal the decision by the league. Riot-trained police dispensed tear gas to chase away dozens of angry Olympiakos fans who ran onto the pitch and destroyed advertising signs, while a number of flares were also thrown by supporters after the match with AEK. Two hours before kick-off, about 100 Olympiakos hooligans fought briefly with police outside the Karaiskakis Stadium and a window was smashed on the coach carrying the AEK players after it was pelted with rocks.
