JOHANNESBURG – The South African selectors on Saturday named two uncapped players, Heinrich Klaasen and Wiaan Mulder, in a 15-man squad for the first two Tests against Australia. The first Test starts in Durban on Thursday. Wicketkeeper-batsman Klaasen is rewarded for his form in the limited-overs matches against India following an injury to Quinton de Kock, while Mulder, who turned 20 last week, is a promising all-rounder. De Kock is back in the squad, however, and is probably favourite to get the gloves. Heinrich Klaasen has made a huge impact in the Proteas batting lineup.

"We firmly believe he can become just as good a player in the five-day format," said Zondi, pointing to an average of nearly 50 in four-day matches this season. But he added: "We are also keen to have a back-up wicketkeeper to De Kock in the squad."
