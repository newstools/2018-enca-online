CAPE TOWN - President Jacob Zuma has concluded his meeting with his Cabinet in Cape Town on Tuesday afternoon. According to Minister of Communications, Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane, calls for Zuma to step down or, alternatively, for the State of the Nation Address (SONA) to be postponed until he does were not discussed and the meeting was "nothing unusual." Zuma's spokesman Bongani Ngqulunga said the president was chairing routine cabinet committee meetings in Cape Town on Tuesday. Ngqulunga said a full cabinet meeting was scheduled for next Wednesday, dismissing speculation the embattled president had called a meeting to discuss his future with his cabinet colleagues. The meeting comes a day before the ANC NEC meeting scheduled for Wednesday. Pressure is mounting on Zuma to resign before Thursday's SONA. A motion of no confidence in Zuma will be debated later this month. On Tuesday, opposition parties are set to meet with National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete to discuss the SONA. - Additional reporting Reuters eNCA
