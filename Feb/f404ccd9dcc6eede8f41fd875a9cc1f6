JOHANNESBURG - Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has sought to clarify what is taking place between him and President Jacob Zuma. Ramaphosa confirmed on Wednesday that he had met with Zuma, saying their discussions were constructive and laid the basis for a speedy resolution to the leadership question in South Africa. He said in a statement they agreed to postpone the special ANC executive committee meeting that was scheduled for later on Wednesday.

Ramaphosa said he was aware that the uncertainty surrounding the future of Zuma was a cause of concern for many South Africans. "This is understandable. However, I am certain that the process we have now embarked on will achieve an outcome that not only addresses these concerns but unites our people around the tasks that all of us must necessarily undertake to build our country. We will be able to communicate further on President Zuma’s position as President of the Republic once we have finalised all pertinent matters," Ramaphosa said. "This is a challenging time for our country. Both President Zuma and myself are aware that our people want and deserve closure. The constructive process we have embarked on offers the greatest opportunity to conclude this matter without discord or division," he said. Though Sona (the State of the Nation Address) has been postponed, the work of government was continuing as usual, Ramaphosa said. eNCA
