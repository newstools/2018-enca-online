JOHANNESBURG - An 18-year-old high school pupil appeared in a Limpopo court for allegedly stabbing a fellow pupil who was declared dead on arrival at the hospital. ''It is alleged that the two learners had a heated argument in the classroom which led to this fatal stabbing,'' said police spokesman Brigadier Moatshe Ngoepe. "The 18-year-old pupil was certified dead on arrival at the hospital." The suspect appeared before the Senwabarwana magistrate's court on Thursday on a charge of murder. His case was postponed to 2 March for a formal bail application and further police investigations. Provincial police commissioner Major General Jan Scheepers said parents and guardians are encouraged to ensure that all children go to school unarmed. "Schools are expected to be a safe and secured learning environment without any act of violence or criminality," he said. African News Agency
