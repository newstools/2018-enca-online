CENTURION - Manish Pandey and Mahendra Singh Dhoni punished South Africa's bowlers as India recovered from a poor start in the second Twenty20 international at SuperSport Park on Wednesday. India, sent in to bat, made 188 for four after being 45 for three. Pandey made a career-best 79 not out off 48 balls while Dhoni thrashed 52 not out off 28 balls. The pair put on 98 off 56 balls in an unbeaten fifth wicket partnership. Pandey came to the wicket after a rare failure by Indian captain Virat Kohli, who was caught behind for one off fast bowler Junior Dala. Having been a spectator during India's 5-1 one-day international series victory, Pandey followed up his 29 not out in India's 28-run win in the first T20 clash with a polished inning which included six fours and three sixes. Zambian-born Dala was South Africa's best bowler, taking two for 28. AFP
