NAIROBI - Kenyan police on Saturday briefly detained a third opposition legislator who attended a symbolic "swearing-in" of opposition leader Raila Odinga that was a direct challenge to President Uhuru Kenyatta, who won re-election in October 2017. The government has made several arrests and suspended three television channels that had planned to stream Tuesday's event. "George Aladwa was arrested at his house and is currently being held at the headquarters of the Directorate of Criminal Investigation," his lawyer Nelson Havi told Reuters. READ: Second leader present in Odinga's swearing in arrested "He was interrogated in connection with the oath taken by Kenyan main opposition leader Raila Odinga as the people's president," he said. A police spokesman said he was not aware of his detention. The arrest follows that of opposition politician Miguna Miguna, who was detained in a dawn raid on his Nairobi home on Friday and that of another opposition leader a day earlier. Miguna was released on bail of 50,000 Kenyan shillings (R6,045). READ: Kenyan radio, TV gagged as thousands gather for opposition leader's 'inauguration' Miguna stood beside Odinga at Tuesday's rally and declared himself the "general" of Odinga's National Resistance Movement, which authorities have designated a "criminal group" because of its stated intent to establish a parallel government. Kenya's ban on three private television stations defied a court order to lift the move. The media shut down has been criticised by the United Nations and the United States.
