JOHANNESBURG - The South African Policing Union (Sapu) on Wednesday said it welcomes the appointment of Bheki Cele as the new police minister. President Cyril Ramaphosa named Cele -- a former national police commissioner -- in the new Cabinet earlier this week. Sapu said it holds Cele in high regard because of "our engagements with him whilst he was the national police commissioner". In a statement, Sapu said Cele proved his passion for policing although he was never a career police officer. "We join thousands of law-abiding citizens who are excited about his appointment. "Already functionary members on the ground are looking forward to a minister that will walk with them in the difficult journey of combating crime." WATCH: Cele has a cloud over him: analyst Sapu said Cele must prioritise support for police officers when they face legal challenges regarding "unfortunate killings" of crime suspects. It said Cele's appointment is more of continuity as he is familiar with policing at a practical level. "The moral of our members has been boosted by this appointment as members feel Minister Cele is one of our own. "We hope to continue working with him as we did during his previous stint in the police". African News Agency
