JOHANNESBURG - David Phetoe, who played the original Paul Moroka on hit-TV soapie Generations, has passed away. While many will fondly remember him as the father of Archie and Karabo Moroka, he was also part of Johannesburg’s vibrant black cultural scene in the 1950s. In 1959, Phetoe appeared in Athol Fugard’s Nongogo at the Bantu Men’s Social Centre - the hub of black South African political, intellectual and creative activity at the time. It is understood the actor was ill and taken to hospital where he died. He was 85-years-old. eNCA
