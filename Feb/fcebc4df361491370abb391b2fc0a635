The Limpopo side’s inconsistency continues to hamper their progress but they still managed to cling to seventh spot on the log. Baroka, who had won just two of their last 12 league matches heading to Qwa Qwa and harvested just 11 points from a possible 36, were devoid of any genuine attacking flair or imagination and struggled to maintain possession, particularly in the final third of the field. Their isolated assaults on the home side’s goal were comfortably seen off by a well-organised Stars defence and their Ivorian ‘keeper Badra Ali Sangara was rarely troubled.

Ea Lla Koto at no stage lost control of the match and were rewarded for a sustained period of pressure when Siphelele Mthembu slotted the ball into the back of the net from a well-worked build-up, to double their lead midway through the second period.
