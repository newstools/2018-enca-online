JOHANNESBURG – ANC spokesperson, Pule Mabe, says the decision to recall President Jacob Zuma is final. Mabe said: “That decision is not negotiable by the way I forgot to say that. It’s very important to just indicate that decision on the recall is final. The only other structure really of the ANC that can turn around the decision of the NEC is either the NGC or the national conference.” “As it stands now we have got a decision ad we are doing everything in our power to make sure the execution of this decision is done in the most peaceful manner possible,” he added.

Meanwhile, ANC veteran, Cheryl Carolus said the process of recalling Zuma could not be rushed. “The reason why the ANC took this time and wasn’t going to be rushed is because you can’t conduct yourself like a Kangaroo court. The ANC has actually gone through all this processes, all its constituencies, briefed civil society about his process and so today it’s ready and able to take that decision. Have you seen anybody taking to the streets in horror or outrage about the decision? No, because I think Cyril Ramaphosa and his team the NEC has taken their time to take our members along with us and to take society along with us.” READ: Resign or face 'the vultures': Mantashe tells Zuma Earlier, Zuma told the SABC that he has not been given compelling reasons by the ANC's top six as to why he should resign.
