JOHANNESBURG - Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi says officials implicated in the Life Esidimeni tragedy should be held accountable. Motsoaledi was speaking at a healing ceremony in Pretoria on Saturday for the families of the victims who died in the tragedy. “We are still going to have inquests by a magistrate. People don’t just die and it ends there. We need to know what happened and how did people die," said Motsoaledi.
