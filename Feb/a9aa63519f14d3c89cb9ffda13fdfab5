CAPE TOWN – Lehlohonolo Majoro scored a brace against his former team to see Bidvest Wits triumph 2-1 over hots Cape Town City at the Athlone Stadium on Saturday evening. Two goals from ‘The Major’ saw the Clever Boys secure a fifth win from their last seven league matches to move up to eighth place on the log. The Citizens, who scored with Craig Martin, have now lost three league games in a row and remain in sixth. The match got off to a physical start, with aggressive challenges flying in, and Wits had both Keegan Ritchie and Edwin Gyimah booked side the opening 22 minutes. Both teams suffered injury blows in the first half, with City forced to replace Matthew Rusike with Nana Akosah-Bempah and the Clever Boys sending on Vincent Pule in place of Frank Mhango. City generally enjoyed the better of play through a stop-start first stanza, but it was the Johannesburg side who claimed the lead on the cusp of the interval when former Citizens striker Lehlohonolo Majoro took advantage of some poor defending to find the net. The Cape side took 15 minutes of the second half to hit back, with some fine skill from Bradley Ralani teeing up winger Craig Martin to score with a deflected shot and level the game at 1-1 on the hour mark. Yet any thoughts City had that they would go on and win the match were shattered in the 73rd minute when Majoro got on the end of a Sifiso Halnti cross to net his second of the evening, putting the Clever Boys back into the lead at 2-1. City pushed hard for a second equaliser in what remained of the game, but Wits were able to hold firm in defence and claim all three points on offer. African News Agency
