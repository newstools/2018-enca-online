WATCH: Mbalula maps the way forward for the Hawks In what he described as a major breakthrough, Mbalula said six of those arrested were the brains behind the killings and three were involved in pulling the trigger. “We must not only arrest the trigger puller but the person who ordered it as well. We’ve been in the Eastern Cape, in KwaZulu-Natal and now we are in the North West,” he added. “SAPS’ operations are focused on taking down the syndicate heads, not just 'minions' employed to kill.” READ: House used as a 'brothel' demolished in Mbalula's presence Mbalula also sent a stern warning to those who are responsible for political murders in KwaZulu-Natal. “They are not the untouchables, the long hand of the law will find them.” “It does not mean that those who have engaged in such activities in KwaZulu-Natal and everywhere else will not be found… We are coming for them,” Mbalula added.
