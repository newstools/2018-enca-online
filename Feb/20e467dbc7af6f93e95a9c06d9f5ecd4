JOHANNESBURG – The Democratic Alliance says it also wants Parliament to be dissolved. It says while it’s happy that Jacob Zuma's resigned, it believes the country needs a fresh start. On Thursday, EFF said it had no faith in the ANC and called for the dissolution of Parliament and fresh elections. LIVE VIDEO AND BLOG: Parliament to elect new president “We don't only have a Jacob Zuma problem, we have an ANC problem...therefore today it would be inappropriate for us to say we support Cyril Ramaphosa... Parliament must be dissolved...the sooner SA can go to the polls its better...proceed to dissolve parliament...South Africa needs that fresh start,” said DA leader, Mmusi Maimane. Maimane was briefing the media to set out the DA's position ahead of this afternoon’s National Assembly sitting, which will elect the President of South Africa. This comes after President Zuma resigned after his party recalled him. eNCA
