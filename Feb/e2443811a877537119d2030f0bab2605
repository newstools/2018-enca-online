JOHANNESBURG - Newly appointed Minister of Mineral Resources Gwede Mantashe has a sound and fundamental knowledge of the industry, the Chamber of Mines said on Tuesday. President Cyril Ramaphosa appointed Mantashe, who is chairman of the ANC, to the cabinet in Monday night's reshuffle. Congratulations Minister Mantashe. We look forward to the many engagements that doubtless lie ahead. https://t.co/bbtxgbUHrg "He (Mantashe) is a person with whom our industry has long held a constructive and respectful relationship," the chamber said. "He is an extremely tough negotiator, demonstrated both during his time as general secretary of the NUM (National Union of Mineworkers) and in his subsequent political positions. We look forward to the many engagements with him that doubtless lie ahead."

The chamber, which represents mining companies, said Ramaphosa's "swift and decisive action" with the reshuffle, especially in the economic cluster,  showed his commitment to ethical leadership and governance in state institutions. Ramaphosa has brought back Nhlanhla Nene as finance minister, more than two years after he was sacked by former president Jacob Zuma in a move that rattled financial markets. Pravin Gordhan is back as public enterprises minister, about a year after he was also controversially removed as finance minister by Zuma. African News Agency
