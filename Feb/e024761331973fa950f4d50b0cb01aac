JOHANNESBURG - Sharks coach Robert du Preez is hoping to set a good precedent for the season when his side, led by lock Ruan Botha, take on the Lions in their opening Super Rugby match of 2018 on Saturday at Ellis Park, in Johannesburg. “This is an important game and a great start will set the tone for our campaign.  We are excited to go out there and play,” said Du Preez. READ: Lions sign new sponsor for next three years “This squad has worked extremely hard in the pre-season and what’s especially pleasing to see is the vibe and excitement in the group. “Every player was given an opportunity during the warm-up games and so many of them put their hands up, which made it extremely difficult to decide on our match-day 23.  Naturally, the guys who have been left out will feel desperately disappointed as they have all put in the hard yards.  I stressed the fact that this campaign is going to be a squad effort and every guy will be called upon, at different stages, to contribute to the team’s goals.” Sharks team:15.
