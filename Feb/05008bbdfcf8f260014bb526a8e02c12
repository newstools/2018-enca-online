JOHANNESBURG – Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services has urgently called Public Protector, Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane to appear before the Committee to explain her statements in public over the recent weeks. READ: Mkhwebane's actions reflect a captured person: SACP Committee Chairperson, Dr Mathole Motshekga, said the Committee is extremely concerned with these comments and needs clarity on “what exactly she is trying to convey. We have further noted with grave concern allegations of her office suppressing some evidence. This type of allegations only tarnishes the good image of the office of the Public Protector.” She is expected to appear on Wednesday in Parliament. eNCA
