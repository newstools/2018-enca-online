PYEONGCHANG - When North Korea's chef de mission at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in the South visited an athletes' village fitness centre he made a point of cheerily greeting each volunteer by name, reading them off their badges. But Won Gil-U came to a screeching halt when he met a young woman called Ko Jong-Un, a report said. Her forename matches that of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, and Won -- who is also Pyongyang's vice sports minister -- was stunned into silence.

"When he turned to me, he stared at my name tag and froze for a few seconds without a word," Ko was quoted as saying by Yonhap news agency. "Then, he said: 'I wouldn't dare to pronounce your name'. We all broke into hearty laughter." The ruling Kim dynasty are revered within North Korea, where Kim Jong-Un is normally referred to as "Supreme Leader" or "Respected Marshal".

Like some other Korean forenames, Jong-Un can be used for both men and women -- although it is predominantly female. Another North Korean official asked Ko about her job. She told him she is a student majoring in American culture at Sogang University in Seoul. "Then he responded: 'All Yankees must be punched'," she said. "This sparked more laughter." AFP
