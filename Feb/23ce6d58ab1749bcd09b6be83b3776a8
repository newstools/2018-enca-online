BRITS  – Two people have died due to listeriosis in North West Province, Health MEC Magome Masike said on Thursday. "We lost one patient in Klerksdorp and another in Rustenburg, we got another on admitted now to [hospital in] Klerksdorp. Listeriosis has always been a disease that has been there, it responds to ordinary drugs, its easy to treat, you can kill it with penicillin, the difficulty is to detect it," Masike said. He said listeriosis presents flu-like symptoms and when it gets worse it presents gastroenteritis (diarrhea and vomiting).  "Anybody can have diarrhea and vomiting, unless you do the right test," he said. He said only three cases have been reported in the province to date. Listeriosis affects mainly pregnant women, newborns, the elderly and adults with impaired immune systems.
