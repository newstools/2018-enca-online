	"The President indicated to the Speaker that he will be engaging with Minister Van Rooyen on the content of the Public Protector’s report and will revert to the National Assembly within the directed time frame on the action he has taken." Earlier in the month, Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane found Van Rooyen lied to Parliament when he said he had not met with the controversial Gupta family since he took office. eNCA
