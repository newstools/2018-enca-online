JOHANNESBURG – The day when Cape Town taps run dry, dubbed Day Zero has been pushed further aback to 9 July, Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane said on Tuesday. Initially, forecasters had predicted 12 April as a day the Mother city runs dry before it was pushed back by four days to 16 April. Since then, it has been pushed back twice from April to May and May to June. While the city is thriving to reach its target of 450 megalitres per day, Maimane has since lauded efforts that have brought down water daily usage by three megalitres as a step towards the right direction. READ: SA drought declared national disaster, Day Zero pushed back “Over the past week, consumption has averaged 523 ML per day,” Maimane said in a statement. “We must all continue to use under 50L per day so that Day Zero can be pushed even further back and it can be defeated altogether.” eNCA
