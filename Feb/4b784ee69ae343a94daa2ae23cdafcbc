VOSMAN, Mpumalanga - The Mpumalanga MEC for community safety Pat Ngomane is expected to visit the family of the two children who were abducted a couple of weeks ago. The community says the 13-year-old girl was targeted because she was living with albinism. It’s believed the kidnappers mistakenly believed the toddler also had the condition.
