JOHANNESBURG – President Jacob Zuma is meeting with Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini on Monday. Reports suggest Zuma was summoned to meet with the King after meetings with the party’s newly elected top six. The ANC’s National Working Committee will meet later on Monday to discuss Zuma’s future as head of state. The Presidency said in a statement that the meeting was initially meant to take place in January but was postponed due to diary challenges on both sides. eNCA
