JOHANNESBURG - Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille wants DA members to vote with their conscience during the no-confidence motion against her. She’s launched an urgent application at the Western Cape High Court. READ: De Lille dodges another bullet De Lille says she’s aware that the DA Caucus supports the motion of no confidence against her. She says the party’s constitution makes this decision binding on all members, even those who didn’t vote for it. De Lille is also demanding a secret vote during the motion, next week Thursday. She says this will ensure that her supporters can vote against the motion, without any fear of being side-lined by the party. eNCA
