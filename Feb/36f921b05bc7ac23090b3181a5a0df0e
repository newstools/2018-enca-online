CAPE TOWN – A cold front is heading to Cape Town and is expected to make landfall on Friday afternoon. Weather prediction models are indicating that rainfall amounts will be around 10mm in the city and surrounding areas. This will be welcomed news as Cape Town faces its worst drought in over a century with taps expected to run dry in early July. Behind the cold front, a high pressure will ridge in, pushing moisture to the south coast, spreading to the east coast on Sunday. At the same time, a strong upper air system will move over southern South Africa. This will result in the cloudy, wet and cold weather for the Garden Route, Klein Karoo and Eastern Cape on Saturday, reaching KwaZulu-Natal late on Saturday afternoon. Rain is expected for the greater part of Saturday in the Eastern Cape and along the south coast. Temperatures will also be affected. Bergwind conditions ahead of the front on Friday will lead to maximum temperatures of 35 - 40 °C in the southern Karoo and Eastern Cape. However, temperatures will plummet on Saturday by more than 10 °C. Temperatures this afternoon along the south coast won’t reach 20 ºC. Daytime highs are likely to peak in the lower twenties over the interior of the Western and Eastern Cape.
