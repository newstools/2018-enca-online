JOHANNESBURG – The new presenter for Mzansi Magic's hit reality show Our Perfect Wedding, Kayise Ngqula, raised the ire of fans on Sunday night. Kayise Ngqula named as new #OPWPresenterSearch host The show follows the journey couples take as they head for the altar. On Sunday, Ngqula angered viewers when she broke the confidence of the bride and asked the groom a question the bride expressly said she did not want to talk about. Fans took to Twitter, saying Ngqula had disrespected the bride. It's not hating when we critique Kayise. For some of us her questions are too personal and she does get a bit loud at times. We just want to enjoy the show, DSTV is already expensive enough so they'd better deliver good content. #OurPerfectWedding Pre-briefing about relevant questions to ask will be appreciated next time. The presenter can be a bit shallow #OurPerfectWedding pic.twitter.com/JouRcDvMeI #OurPerfectWedding the presenter mxmmmm. pic.twitter.com/P1q5PvMaFl Hmmm, I am not really impressed with how the presenter handled today's show. The questions asked ay#OurPerfectWedding The OPW presenter Must Be Crucified for Asking Personal Questions .. last Week we Warned for the very same Nonsense but she is still Continuing #OurPerfectWedding Someone needs to teach this girl what questions to ask and how to ask them! She makes people feel uncomfortable man #OurPerfectWedding Why did the presenter ask about the kids behind the Brides back after she said she doesn't want to discuss it... Nah that was wrong.. #OurPerfectWedding #OPW Doesn't the presenter get a briefing from the producers about the type of questions to ask------#OurPerfectWedding She didn’t want to talk about kids and instead of respecting her wishes, you then asked the husband in her absence. THAT IS SO DISRESPECTFUL- YOU ---- OWE ---- HER ---- AN ---- APOLOGY #OurPerfectWedding #opwmzansi #opw Fans of the show also appear to think Kayise is too loud. I'm still asking why is Kayise shouting at us guys ???? #OurPerfectWedding pic.twitter.com/BeJv5IbMw9 Imagine inviting kayise( new presenter) to your wedding and she stand infront of the gate and shout "simenyiwe"--even those that didn't know will show up #OurPerfectWedding pic.twitter.com/m8z9hrH5eB #OurPerfectWedding
