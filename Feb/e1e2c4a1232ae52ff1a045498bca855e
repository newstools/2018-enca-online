JOHANNESBURG - The controversial Bank of Baroda will no longer operate in South Africa, dealing another blow to the Guptas. The Indian state-owned bank has notified the Office of the Registrar of Banks of its decision, the South African Reserve Bank (Sarb) said in a statement on Monday. "The Registrar... is in discussions with the Bank of Baroda to ensure its orderly withdrawal from South Africa so that no depositor is disadvantaged," Sarb said.
