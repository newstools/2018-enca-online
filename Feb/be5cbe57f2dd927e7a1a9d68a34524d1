COPENHAGEN - Denmark's Noma, crowned the world's best restaurant four times in the past decade by Restaurant magazine, reopened on Friday at a new location on a former shipyard island in Copenhagen harbour, with a menu that will change with the seasons. The restaurant that has put Copenhagen on the foodie world map and acted as a breeding ground for a new Nordic cuisine will open with a menu designed to "celebrate Scandinavian seafood... at its absolute best during the cold, winter months." After winning “best restaurant in the world” four times, Noma’s chef-owner Rene Redzepi closed the doors to rethink everything. Here, he shows us some of his new menu. https://t.co/uUSXQ4D0DF pic.twitter.com/Ij4bhiqFEY That will be followed by a season of plant-based dishes and a game and forest season at the 40-seat restaurant. Students will be able to reserve seats at a reduced price. Noma, which is headed by 40-year-old chef René Redzepi, has in recent years set up temporary 'pop-up' restaurants in Tokyo, Sydney and Tulum in Mexico. Its original Copenhagen restaurant has been shut for around a year. Reuters
