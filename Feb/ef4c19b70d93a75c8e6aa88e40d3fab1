CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape High Court is expected to hand down judgment in the urgent matter between Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille and the Democratic Alliance which is pushing for her removal from office. De Lille brought an urgent application to have a motion of no confidence in her, set down for council on Thursday, to be conducted via secret ballot. On Tuesday, De Lille's legal counsel Advocate Dali Mpofu said the party had no intention of keeping De Lille in her position as their first instinct was to vote her out of office without considering a hearing.

Referring to Western Cape Premier Helen Zille, who has been at the centre of a number of controversies in recent months, Mpofu said that De Lille was being treated differently. "Are allegations of corruption worse than allegations of racism?" he asked. Judgment is set to be handed down at 2pm. African News Agency
