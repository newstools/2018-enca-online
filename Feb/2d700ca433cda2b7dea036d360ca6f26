JOHANNESBURG – South African Revenue Services (SARS) commissioner, Tom Moyane, on Tuesday welcomed and congratulated Nhlanhla Nene on his re-appointment as the finance minister. Nene was returned to the position during President Cyril Ramaphosa's cabinet reshuffle on Monday. Nene had been unceremoniously fired by former president Jacob Zuma in December 2015, wiping billions off the stock market. Moyane said that SARS' leadership previously had a collegial and effective working relationship.

"SARS appreciates Minister Nene's passion, experience and insightful leadership which will enhance the organisation’s commitment to being an efficient and effective tax authority." Moyane said that Nene's leadership will further galvanise the SARS workforce and boost morale in a challenging economic environment.

However, Moyane may not be in his position for long, after Ramaphosa stated in his State of the Nation Address that he will fix leadership issues at the tax collector urgently. Moyane had a fractious relationship with former finance minister Pravin Gordhan, over restructuring at SARS, which saw an outflux of senior staffers. Moyane was also behind the Hawks investigation into Gordhan over the so-called SARS rogue unit, a case that was later withdrawn. African News Agency
