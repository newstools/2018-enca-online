CAPE TOWN - The State of the Nation Address (SONA) would be delivered by whoever the South African President is on 8 February, Parliament's presiding officers said on Thursday. "We have absolutely no intention as presiding officers to approach any president to say you must not come and give the State of the Nation Address. "Whoever is president will address us," said National Council of Provinces (NCOP) chairwoman Thandi Modise, briefing journalists on preparations for next week's SONA to be delivered to a joint sitting of the National Assembly and NCOP. Modise and fellow presiding officers were asked whether it was factoring in a possibility that Zuma would not be the head of state next week after the African National Congress indicated its top six officials were discussing "options" with the president to prevent him from being impeached. WATCH: SONA 2018 to go ahead as planned The Democratic Alliance has written to National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete asking for the SONA to be postponed until Zuma is removed. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) have asked for a motion of no confidence debate to be scheduled ahead of the speech. The latter has for the past few years disrupted the SONA, with its MPs saying it did not recognise the legitimacy of the Zuma presidency. African News Agency
