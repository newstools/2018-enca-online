JOHANNESBURG – President Cyril Ramaphosa on Friday announced that he would withdraw an appeal contesting a high court decision that National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) head Shaun Abrahams should vacate his post. This means Abrahams will have to fight for his survival alone, in a move showing that he is unlikely to survival in the Ramaphosa administration. President Cyril Ramaphosa is leaving #ShaunAbrahams to fight for his position on his own.

Former president Jacob Zuma had indicated he would appeal the matter. A full bench of the High Court in Pretoria ordered that Zuma cannot appoint, remove or suspend the national director. Nxasana claimed that Zuma had forced him to resign, allegations the former president denied. Judge President Dunstan Mlambo said Nxasana's resignation was procured by the promise of unlawful rewards and that it "would not be just" to reinstate Nxasana or to allow Abrahams to remain. The court then determined that then Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa had 60 days to appoint a new NDPP. eNCA
