JOHANNESBURG – Shaun von Berg grabbed three wickets on the final day as the Titans returned to the top of the Sunfoil Series table with a tame draw against the Cape Cobras at Willowmoore Park in Benoni on Sunday. The leg-break bowler finished with 3/54 in 16 overs as the visitors reached 185/6, before declaring with a target of 268 for the hosts. But the match laboured to a draw after the Titans reached 57/2 in 17.5 overs when the match ended. The home side walked away with 12.42 points from the match, just enough to help them regain top spot which they had lost to the Warriors on Saturday after the latter had beaten the Highveld Lions. But Mark Boucher’s side saw their lead substantially cut with four matches to play. Their 92.1 point total is just over five points clear of the Eastern Cape franchise, with most of the other teams, including the Cobras, also making gains. However, the result of Sunday was a mere formality after only two innings had been completed over the first three days. The third innings of the game resumed on day four with the Cape side 82 runs ahead and they batted for 50.1 overs in a bid to try and force an unlikely result. Aviwe Mgijima top-scored with 43, while there was 36 apiece from Zubayr Hamza and Kyle Verreynne, before the declaration. Von Berg’s three-for was supported by 2/23 by Junior Dala. Elgar then hit 27 before falling and the match ending without a winner. African News Agency
