JOHANNESBURG - Four people were killed in three separate domestic disputes in Limpopo on Saturday, provincial police said. In Mokwakwaila outside Tzaneen, a 40-year-old man was burnt to death inside his house after a domestic dispute with his wife. It is alleged the man had severely assaulted the woman until she was rescued by community members and taken to the hospital. The man took his children and locked them inside the house and set it alight. The children were removed unharmed but the man was burnt beyond recognition. The motive behind the incident is unclear.

"The South African Police Service in this province would like to condemn in the strongest possible terms the continuous acts of domestic related killings which are still taking place in some areas of the province. "Members of the community are still encouraged and advised to make use of the local relevant authorities for intervention in case of any domestic related situations instead of killing or attacking one another," Limpopo police said in a statement on Sunday. eNCA
