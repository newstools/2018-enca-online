JOHANNESBURG – Platinum Stars and SuperSport United played to a frustrating goalless draw in their Absa Premiership clash at Royal Bafokeng Stadium on Tuesday evening. Neither side was able to get their attack in gear through the course of the match and it ended in a forgettable stalemate that does little to help either of them: Dikwena remain bottom of the log and five points adrift of safety, while Matsatsantsa move up two places to 10th but missed out on a return to the top half of the table. SuperSport had the first effort on goal, in the eighth minute, as Clayton Daniels got on the end of Siyabonga Nhlapo’s cross and directed a header on target, only to see goalkeeper Dino Visser make a fine save. Two minutes later Stars were controversially denied a goal, with Vuyo Mere beating Riyaad Pieterse to a through ball and scoring with a low shot, only to see the offside flag raised. Television replays showed Letsie Koapeng was offside at the time the pass was played, but the striker pulled out of his run and got nowhere near the ball. Midway through the first half, Koapeng had a shot on target from just outside the penalty area, but Pieterse dived to his left to make a fine save, while Riyaad Norodien and Vuyo Mere also sent shots over the crossbar in the 10 minutes before the interval. SuperSport came out with more intent at the start of the second half, but it was Dikwena who threatened again when young midfielder Charles Baloyi had a chance after a quick turn in the box, but he sent his effort just wide of the post. United look to spark their attack to life by sending on substitutes Teboho Mokoena and Thabo Mnyamane, with the former somewhat unlucky to put a shot over the crossbar after bursting into the box to meet a left-wing cross in the 64th minute. That proved to be the last real chance for either side, in a match which was dominated by the defences. African News Agency
