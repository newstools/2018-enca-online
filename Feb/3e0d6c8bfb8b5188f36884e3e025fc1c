JOHANNESBURG - Former acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane is expected to hand himself over to the authorities on Thursday. He’s expected to face corruption and money-laundering charges in the Specialised Commercial Crimes court. Charges against Phahlane, his wife and the businessman relate to cars the couple received - allegedly as part of a corrupt scheme. In December, police raided seven properties linked to Phahlane, his wife and police contractor Keith Keating. It’s alleged that Keating’s company, Forensic Data Analysts, received R5-billion in contracts since 2010. The Ipid alleges that Keating paid for vehicles for Phahlane and his family.  eNCA
