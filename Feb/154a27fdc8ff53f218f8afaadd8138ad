DURBAN - The Kwa-Zulu Natal ANC says they will welcome back the son of the soil from the Union Buildings. This comes after Jacob Zuma resigned as president of the republic late on Wednesday night. In a media briefing on Thursday, provincial Interim Committee Co-ordinator Sihle Zikalala says they will continue to use former president Jacob Zuma in the province. Zikalala, a former Zuma ally, praised the former president as having served the ANC with distinction. "We will be organising welcome back celebrations for the son of the soil of President Zuma who has served this movement and we will be richer with him in the province," said Zikalala.

"A recall is not nice, you wouldn't want that on someone else,” said Zikalala. “We had that feeling, it was an emotional period but be it doesn't mean the ANC was wrong."

"Yes former President Zuma is a victim of political prosecution, he was attacked from several fronts,” he said. "I don't know if he is guilty of anything, only courts can determine that." KwaZulu Natal was always seen as the stronghold of the former president but of late, it has split right down the middle. Just recently, some supporters of newly elected ANC NEC member Senzo Mchunu had wanted Zuma to resign.
