DURBAN - Sixteen people have been arrested in connection with an incident of taxi violence that occurred at the Brook Street taxi rank in Durban on Friday afternoon. A group of heavily armed men travelling in a Toyota Quantum minibus taxi "stormed" the taxi rank, police spokesperson Thembeka Mbhele said. They fired multiple gunshots before speeding off. Three people were seriously wounded and taken to the hospital, but a 56-year-old victim later died.

"The case will be assigned to the provincial task team for further investigation. The firearms will be subjected to ballistic testing to ascertain if they were used in any other pending cases," Mbhele said. “In this province, we will not tolerate any violence, especially relating to (the) taxi industry, as members of community are normally caught during the exchange of gunfire. We work diligently to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to book,” said KwaZulu-Natal acting police commissioner Bheki Langa. African News Agency
