JOHANNESBURG – A strike is looming in the public service sector in South Africa. This after negotiations with government were not fruitful, the South African Public Servants Association (PSA) said on Friday. Public workers are asking for a 12 percent hike across the board. The union is pleading with the government to listen to the demands of workers. The PSA says talks with government deadlocked in September 2017. Close to 230,000 public sector workers could go on strike if they do not receive the above-mentioned hikes. PSA Deputy General Manager Tahir Maepa says they are giving government 30 days to come up with a reasonable offer before they take mass action. “If this is not resolved, the public services is going to collapse,” he added.

The Independent Labour Caucus (ILC) says employees have been patient, especially during the recent changes in government. “Honestly, our members are getting tired. We were supposed to have introduced the salary adjustments already and we are in the middle of April and there has still been no movement,” the ILC’s Basil Manuel said. eNCA
