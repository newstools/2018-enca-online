JOHANNESBURG - The Department of Public Service and Administration on Sunday asked for more time to deal with deadlocked wage negotiations in the public sector. The South African Public Servants Association (PSA) on Friday warned of a looming strike in the sector after negotiations with government were not fruitful. Workers are demanding a 12 percent wage hike across the board with the PSA saying talks deadlocked in September 2017. The department has now requested more time from the Public Service Coordinating Bargaining Council (PSCBC) in order to consult.
