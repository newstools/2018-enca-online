JOHANNESBURG - Unions have vowed to intensify their crippling national bus strike, saying their employers are negotiating "in bad faith." #BusStrike statement from the unions on why the strike continues pic.twitter.com/fgSuUDv9uL #BusStrike continues after talks broke down between unions and employer organisations pic.twitter.com/OFgwNE9yWX BREAKING #BusStrike Mahlangu "We have resolved to intensify the strike" #BusStrike Mahlangu " Employers adopted an insultitive attitude. Employers came to CCMA to say that they could do 8% if unions dropped all other demands" #BusStrike Jim " A strike is the last resort it is not a party. Employers completely refuse to negotiate." #BusStrike Mahlangu "we call on communties to bear with us. We call on govt to also intervene" #BusStrike Mahlangu "we offered to give them a 2 year agreement. Unfortunately the employer rejected it" READ: Nationwide bus strike enters third day Unions are demanding a 12 percent wage increase, but employers are only offering seven percent. Cosatu said it wanted a quick resolution to the strike and said the working class was suffering the most. The South Africa Transport and Allied Workers Union (Satawu) said the ongoing strike could have been prevented if employers negotiated in good faith. #BusStrike Mahlangu "we had dropped our demand from 12% to 9.5%" #BusStrike Jim " we intensifying strike to end the strike. Govt must intervene. We moved from our positions as unions but employer was negotiating at bad faith." #BusStrike Numsa's Irvin Jim "all those doubting thomas's must join the strike until employers meet our demands" Meanwhile, the Essential Services Committee has approached the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) to have public transport declared an essential service. The group wants the CCMA to probe the possibility, in accordance with section 71 of the Labour Relations Act. “It is our earnest belief that public transport fits this description. It affects hospitals, clinics schools and also the other essential services that have been designated because they can’t function if their workers arrive late or do not arrive at all.” The group’s secretary general said essential services were essentially on strike, by default. eNCA
