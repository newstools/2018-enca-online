JOHANNESBURG - Unions have vowed to intensify their crippling national bus strike, saying their employers are negotiating "in bad faith." READ: Nationwide bus strike enters third day Unions are demanding a 12 percent wage increase, but employers are only offering seven percent. Cosatu said it wanted a quick resolution to the strike and said the working class was suffering the most. The South Africa Transport and Allied Workers Union (Satawu) said the ongoing strike could have been prevented if employers negotiated in good faith. Meanwhile, the Essential Services Committee has approached the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) to have public transport declared an essential service. The group wants the CCMA to probe the possibility, in accordance with section 71 of the Labour Relations Act. “It is our earnest belief that public transport fits this description. It affects hospitals, clinics schools and also the other essential services that have been designated because they can’t function if their workers arrive late or do not arrive at all.” The group’s secretary general said essential services were essentially on strike, by default. eNCA
