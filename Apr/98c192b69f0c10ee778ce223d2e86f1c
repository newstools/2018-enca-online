I've lost a mother. From the time when all our parents were arrested, she and my other aunt looked after us, took us to school. She's just been a mother figure," said Sisulu. Tributes continued to pour in for Winnie with leaders of the ANC visiting her home in Orlando West in Soweto. Winnie passed away on Monday at the Milpark Hospital. A series of memorial services have been planned around the country. She'll be laid to rest on 14 April 2018. eNCA
