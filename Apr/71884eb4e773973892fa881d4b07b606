JOHANNESBURG - MEC for Education in the Western Cape Debbie Schäfer has expressed her shock and sadness at the fatal shooting of a teacher in front of her pupils in Saldanha Bay. In a statement, Schäfer says the teacher was allegedly shot by her ex-spouse. The perpetrator is reported to have then turned the gun on himself. Both succumbed to their wounds. According to Schäfer, pupils who witnessed the shooting  "are greatly and understandably traumatised, as are the teachers’ two children." Pupils were dismissed early at the school and a school psychologist and social worker will be sent to provide counseling for those in need of assistance or who witnessed the event. Counselling will also be provided for teachers at the school, as well as at its neighbouring school. eNCA
