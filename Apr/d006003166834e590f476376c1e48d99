LUSAKA - Zambia has asked Cuba to recall its ambassador for openly supporting the newly launched opposition Socialist Party, the president's spokesman said on Sunday. Amos Chanda said ambassador Nelson Pages Vilas spoke at the party's launch on Saturday.

The UPND challenged Lungu's 2016 election victory in court, alleging fraud, arguing that that obliged him to hand over power to parliament's speaker until the court considered its petition. Lungu has denied electoral fraud.
