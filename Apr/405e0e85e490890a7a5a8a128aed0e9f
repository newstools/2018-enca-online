JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress's head of elections Fikile Mbalula on Monday outlined a plan for the national ruling party to try and win back control of the Western Cape province ahead of 2019 general elections. ''The African National Congress will enter the 2019 elections seeking a popular mandate from the people, including the Western Cape to continue its programme of a better life for all,'' the party said in a statement. The Democratic Alliance, South Africa's main opposition nationally, took sole control of the provincial government after 2009 elections.
