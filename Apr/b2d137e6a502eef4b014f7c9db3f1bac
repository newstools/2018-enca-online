JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) on Thursday welcomed the resignation of Johan Van Zyl as a board member of Steinhoff International Holdings (SNH). Van Zyl had earlier resigned from Steinhoff’s supervisory board and withdrawn his candidacy for re-election to the board. Van Zyl resigned days before the group’s annual general meeting. READ: How Steinhoff execs cooked the books The DA's David Maynier condemned Van Zyl's "complete failure to take responsibility, and (his) total lack of any remorse", despite being a sitting member of the Supervisory Board when the scandal surrounding “accounting irregularities” emerged. Maynier also noted Van Zyls request for €100,000 (R1.7-million) for “additional work undertaken” as a result of the scandal surrounding “accounting irregularities” at SNH. Maynier noted, "The truth is that Johan van Zyl is an arsonist turned firefighter who has tried to position himself as a crusader, committed to uncovering the truth, and fixing what went wrong, when, in fact, the scandal surrounding “accounting irregularities” took place on his watch."
