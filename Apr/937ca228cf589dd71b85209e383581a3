	JOHANNESBURG - Trade unions held a briefing on Tuesday on public sector wage negotiations. The National Union of Metalworkers of south Africa (Numsa) called on its members to take part in the strike organised by trade union federation, Saftu. Numsa said  the suggested minimum wage was a continuation of racism and should be scrapped. Numsa General Secretary Irvin Jim said the national minimum wage was intended to ensure that President Cyril Ramaphosa keeps white wealth happy. Unions are embarking on a national strike tomorrow demanding that the national minimum wage not be implemented. They also want changes to labour laws to be scrapped. *View the attached video where reasons for Numsa joining the strike are explained in more detail. eNCA
