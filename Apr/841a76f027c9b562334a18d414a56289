JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Opera is in deep financial trouble and may have to close its doors if funding isn't found to keep it afloat. It hosted a free concert on 1 April at the Tin Town Theatre in Ferreirasdorp to highlight its plight. Khayakazi Madlala is one of many singers who depend on Gauteng Opera to help nurture their talent as they break into the world of opera. In her final year of study, she is devastated by the possibility that her career could come to a halt. “It’s a bit disturbing because I’m in my third year and I was supposed to finish this year and hopefully get and internship with the company, so that means I will have an uncompleted study, like I’ve done two and a quarter and I’m not done so it doesn't count for anything.” The organisation's CEO, Arnold Cloete, said support isn't just about money. “We also need the public to support performances because that way people can give and not feel that they have to give 20,000 but just buy a ticket of R100 and attend performances. That will get Gauteng opera to survive,” Cloete said. *View the attached video for more on  this story eNCA went live to the opera with the following programme:- 12:10              “For the beauty of the earth” by Gauteng Opera
