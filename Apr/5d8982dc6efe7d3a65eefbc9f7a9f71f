HONG KONG â€“ The Blitzboks booked their spot in the quarter-finals of the Hong Kong Sevens with a 33-15 victory over England in their pool match on Saturday. England were quicker out the blocks with a try in the first minute by Alex Davis, but South Africa responded quickly with a try from Stedman Gans under the posts. It was then the turn of England to reply and they did so with a William Wilson score. The Blitzboks, though, had the final say of the opening stanza with Selvyn Davids darting over the line to help his side to a 14-10 lead at the break. England started the second half much like the first, with a try - this time by Will Edwards. That score, however, would be the last from the English as the SA team score three unanswered tries coming from Davids, Mfundo Ndlovu and Gans. - African News Agency (ANA), Editing by Michael Sherman African News Agency
