JOHANNESBURG - Convicted racist Vicki Momberg on Wednesday lost her bid for leave to appeal her sentence in the Randburg Magistrate's Court. The former estate agent had been found guilty of four counts of crimen injuria and was sentenced to three years in prison, with one year suspended. WATCH: Racist Momberg doesn't deserve jail time, says sympathiser Momberg had been caught on camera repeatedly calling police officers, who had responded to a smash-and-grab incident, the k-word. Magistrate Pravina Raghoonandan found Momberg had shown no remorse for her actions. eNCA
