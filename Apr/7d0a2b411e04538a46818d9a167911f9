HARARE - Exiled Zimbabwean musician Thomas Mapfumo (72) is back home. He fled to the United States 15 years ago after persecution by former President Robert Mugabeâ€™s regime. Mapfumo says he could finally return home because of the political changes in the country. "There was no rule of law. Everything was just out of order. There was a lot of dictatorship going on. I don't tolerate dictatorship," he told AFP. "The economy is in shambles. We don't have our own currency. The poor are getting poorer, the rich are getting richer." He performed his first concert on home soil after 15 years, and fans are begging for more. Oliver Mtukudzi and a number of other Zimbabwean musicians performed as supporting acts at the homecoming show. * Watch the full video report by Pindai Dube in the gallery above. - Additional reporting AFP eNCA
