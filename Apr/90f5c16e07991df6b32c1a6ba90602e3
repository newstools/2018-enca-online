JOHANNESBURG - The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) says international retailer Zara should share the profits it made from alleged copyright infringements against a top South African brand. Zara has been accused of stealing South African fashion designer Laduma Ngxokoloâ€™s signature sock design. Ngxokolo is taking legal action against Zara as the infringement dented his profits. In a statement released on Tuesday, Ngxokolo said his company was alerted by clients that Zara had "copied one of our signature patterns." "These patterns were appropriated and reproduced in part of their sock range, which they shared as new in their best-sellers on their online store. Their sock range resembles our Khanyisa Cardigan, which was launched in March 2014 at the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Joburg. "The cardigan is still available on our online store and has been on runways. Globally, the piece is still one of our best sellers. The socks have been spotted at Zara outlets in UK, New York and here at home at Zara Sandton, South Africa," he said. eNCA
