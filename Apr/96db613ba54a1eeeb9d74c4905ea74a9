CAPE TOWN - Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille lost her vote on Wednesday. De Lille said she would approach the highest court in the land to make sure that her party does not treat her unfairly. The DA Caucus in Cape Town met on Wednesday evening to vote on an internal motion of no confidence in the mayor. The party's federal executive recently gave the caucus the go-ahead to invoke its new recall clause.

It could be any other mayor; Solly Msimanga or Herman Mashaba. People are already starting to mobilise. I don't mind testing this [even] if it means going to the highest courts to protect also other public representatives from being unfairly treated,” de Lille added.
