WINDHOEK, NamibiaÂ  - The Valke scored six tries on their way to a comprehensive 39-7 (halftime 27-0) victory over the Welwitschias in the SuperSport Rugby Challenge at the Hage Geingob Stadium in Windhoek on Saturday. Such was the dominance of the visitors, who suffered a shock defeat in this fixture last season, had opened up a 15-point advantage after 20 minutes as Number 8, Friedle Olivier and right wing Don Mlondobozi crossed for tries with scrumhalf Andries du Plessis kicking one conversion and a penalty. Had Du Plessis had his kicking boots on, the score could have been far worse with the scrumhalf missing two conversions and inside centre Andrew van Wyk missing one. The burly backrow playmaker, crossed for his second try of the night five minutes before the break with Du Plessis missing the conversion attempt. But the visitors completed a good first half when Du Plessis crossed the whitewash himself and converted to give the Valke a comfortable 27-point advantage. The second stanza was a quiet affair, but the home side finally made their mark on the scoreboard when left-wing Janry du Toit crossed over with scrumhalf Eugene Jantjies adding the two extra points. But that was the last and only time the men from Namibia would trouble the scorers, as the Valke made sure of a successful trip across the border. Replacement winger, Nazeem Wood scored halfway through the second half with Van Wyk failing to add the extras from a tight angle. But the Valke sealed the five log points after the hooter had sounded when replacement prop Andries Schutte barged over with flyhalf Errol Jaggers slotting the conversion. African News Agency
