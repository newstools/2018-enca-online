JOHANNESBURG - The ANC in the Free State has hit out a former finance minister Trevor Manuel for using a memorial service for the late Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, to accuse the party's Secretary-General of corruption. The party on Monday dismissed allegations that millions of rand meant for the Winnie Madikizela-Mandela museum in Brandfort had been misused. During his address last week, Manuel launched a scathing attack on Magashule, who denies the money was spent somewhere else . WATCH: Manuel slams Magashule over Winnie museum "It is unfortunate and reckless for Trevor Manuel to turn the memorial service into a political battle and accuse the ANC Secretary-General for corruption without compelling evidence. It is deliberate and divisive and undermines the spirit of unity renewal. We urge Luthuli House to intervene and reprimand Trevor Manuel," the Free State ANC's William Bulwane during another memorial service for Mama Winnie. The Free State ANC believes the museum will be completed by March 2019. eNCA
