CAPE TOWN – Khayelitsha residents on Friday barricaded roads with burning tyres in a protest over housing. Residents from site B at the Cape Town-based township complained they had been on the city’s housing project since 2014. They say their shacks flood during the rainy season and sometimes, structures are blown away by winds. “Squalor conditions are the root of the outbreak of diseases like Tuberculosis in the area,” one resident said. eNCA
