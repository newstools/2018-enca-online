JOHANNESBURG - Audit firm KPMG has suspended one of its top executives, Sipho Malaba, who had signed off an independent auditor’s report on the accounts of VBS Mutual Bank. VBS was put under curatorship last month due to liquidity issues. Malaba, who had been dealing with the bank's financials, didn’t seem to pick up any irregularities. This is not the first time the audit firm is under scrutiny. KPMG took a blow after its association with the Gupta family, and its involvement in an investigative unit at the South African Revenue Service. READ: BLSA suspends KPMG One economist says that even with a new executive team, the rot at the firm is deep. "Six months later we see a more serious case of misleading, by no other than the newly acquired executive, after they sacked nine in order to put a new culture in place," said Iraj Abedian. "Clearly they have not dealt with the issues. And they haven’t dealt with them,  in my view, because they have not owned up to what the problems were to begin with. What went wrong that they had to lay off, sack or dismiss CEOs?  This is a very serious unprecedented [matter even in the history of audit firms.” One chartered accountant says KMPG should have had another set of eyes look over VBS’s books. “KPMG needs to do a thorough investigation of the deficiencies that clearly do exist in their systems," says Khaya Sithole. "VBS was in the public space for even giving the president a loan. So even if nothing else alarmed you, it should’ve been the idea that at some point in time the public will interrogate these numbers, specifically because of the nature of the client you have. VBS is the bank that granted former president Jacob Zuma a loan for his Nkandla homestead. "So you would think that they would have put additional defence mechanisms in place."
