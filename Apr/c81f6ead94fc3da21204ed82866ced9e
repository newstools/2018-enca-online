CAPE TOWN – The City of Cape Town will assist various organisations to help the needy this coming winter. The city is known for its wet winter which often causes floods in low lying areas. Assistance includes providing for an additional 115 bed spaces and 40 job opportunities in the Expanded Public Works Programme. Other aid consists of food, blankets, mattresses, toiletries and cleaning materials to help cater for an expected increase in the number of street people seeking shelter.

There are a number of NGOs and homeless shelters that we work with and these include Happy Valley home, the facilities in Belleville and the Ubuntu Circle of Courage," said City of Cape Town Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security, JP Smith. "And these are NGOs whose facilities we have screened and safety inspectors have been there and they comply with all the relevant legislation; and their facilities permit us to expand those bed opportunities, just those few more to make sure that we can accommodate few extra people and that we can help them with a few extra toiletries, with money, mattresses and other resources to expand the shelters during this time." eNCA
