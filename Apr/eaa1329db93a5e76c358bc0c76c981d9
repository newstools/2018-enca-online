JOHANNESBURG - Banks want a discussion on how the industry should deal with transformation. The Banking Association of South Africa says growth in the industry depends on making banking facilities accessible to more people. One of the ways the association wants to bring about change is through changing how it procures services.

I get black attorneys who come to me and say, 'We can’t even get through the door', that sort of culture,” he said. The association, which represents the likes of Absa, Nedbank and Standard Bank, says transformation and growth of their business go hand in hand. “If we do not address transformation in a cohesive way, in a sustainable way, we are actually having a negative impact on our ability to grow and develop our business, so it becomes core to our business,” Coovadia said.

Strengthening the role of banks as a transformative factor is key to this. “If we don’t ensure that we bring the majority of our people into the economy we can’t get to the growth rates that we need, let alone sustain those growth rates to actually address the challenges we have. If we do that then in 20 years we are not doing business,” he said. Coovadia said all of this had to be done in a way that ensures the sector remains at the cutting edge of international best practice. eNCA
