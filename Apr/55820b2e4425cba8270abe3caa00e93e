LONDON - The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on Friday announced on Twitter that they had decided a name for their son. They have named the boyÂ Louis Arthur Charles. The name pays tribute to William's great-great uncle Louis Mountbatten, who was killed by the IRA in 1979, while Charles is the name of William's father. Arthur had been the bookmakers' favourite for the couple's third child. Louis is currently the 71st most popular name for a baby boy in England and Wales. Louis weighed eight pounds and seven ounces (3.8 kilogrammes) when he was born at 11:01 am (1001 GMT) on Monday with William, the Duke of Cambridge, present for the birth.

He will hold the title of prince, after the Queen changed the rules in 2012 to ensure that all of William's children would be entitled to the style, not just his eldest son. Prince Louis is also the first male royal who will not overtake his sister in the line of succession after a reform that ends male primogeniture. eNCA
