JOHANNESBURG - The DA has a second shot at a no-confidence vote against Cape Town mayor Patricia De Lille. The party's Cape Town caucus has been granted permission by its federal executive. It must now provide three days' notice before the vote can take place. WATCH: DA must reconsider how it deals with disciplining party members The Cape Town mayor narrowly survived a motion of no confidence in February. De Lille is facing disciplinary proceedings for corruption and bringing the party into disrepute but the hearing was previously postponed indefinitely. The DA's Western Cape leader, Bonginkosi Madikizela, defended the decision, which comes after the party amended its recall clause at its federal congress earlier in the month.
