JOHANNESBURG - After endorsing diversity at its federal congress, the DA has elected just one woman to its top six leadership positions. Five of the top eight were re-elected: leader Mmusi Maimane, federal chairperson Athol Trollip, deputy federal chairpersons Ivan Meyer and Refiloe Nt'sekhe, and chairman of the federal council James Selfe. Trollip had stood against Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga and DA leader in the Free State Annelie Lotriet. Nt'sekhe said she was unfazed by being the only woman in the national leadership. EXPLAINER: DA to elect 'new' leadership MP Mike Waters is the third deputy federal chairperson, replacing Desiree van der Walt.. The DA Women’s Network earlier elected Western Cape Health MEC DrNomafrench Mbombo as its leader, while Luyolo Mphithi is the new youth leader. At a media briefing after the elections, Maimane said the party had chosen a diverse leadership. He said the caucus that would be sent to Parliament would also represent the diversity of South Africa. But this would not be achieved by recruiting people based on their race or gender, Maimane said he wanted more female leaders in the party and this needed to be encouraged at provincial, counciland other levels. eNCA
