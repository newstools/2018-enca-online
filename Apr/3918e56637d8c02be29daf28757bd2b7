EASTERN CAPE - The Eastern Cape father who flung his one-year-old daughter off the roof of a shack during an eviction has been released on a warning. The man has been charged with child abuse. His case has been postponed to the 29 May in the New Brighton Magistrate’s Court. The 38-year-old father was released on a warning after Magistrate Shivan Maharaj heard that he couldn’t afford bail. He and his partner don’t work, and survive off R1200 in child care grants they receive for their four children. The court heard that the man built a shack on vacant municipal land in the Joe Slovo informal settlement because he couldn’t afford the rent for a shack anymore. He has been released on condition that he consults with the social worker assigned to the case to arrange visits with his child. eNCA
