GAUTENG - The Gauteng education department has partnered with the private sector to launch two schools that will specialise in nuclear-energy education. The department says the project is aimed at promoting interest in maths and science, and developing extra skills while pupils are still young. It says it's in talks with the Higher Education Department to ensure the school curriculum introduced is in line with what's taught at universities. eNCA
