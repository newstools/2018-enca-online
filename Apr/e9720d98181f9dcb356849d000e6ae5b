Simbine also won the first major championship since the retirement of Blake's fellow Jamaican Usain Bolt, the 100 and 200m world record-holder. England's Adam Gemili, the 2014 Commonwealth silver-medallist who was second quickest into the final, withdrew before the race after picking up an injury in the semis. Trinidad and Tobago's Michelle-Lee Ahye won the women's 100m in 11.14, ahead of Christania Williams in 11.21 and her fellow Jamaican Gayon Evans, who clocked 11.22. AFP
