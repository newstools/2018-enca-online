READ: Woods, Els confirmed as 2019 Presidents Cup captains Talking about the recent US Masters, Els said he wanted to congratulate Patrick Reed on securing his first Major at Augusta. "You know, in many ways, it’s tough watching on TV when what you really want is to be there in the mix yourself. But putting on my impartial sports’ fan hat, I’ve got to say I enjoyed the coverage. "The scoring was incredible and Patrick deserves that Green Jacket. He made some clutch putts and showed all the qualities that you need to win a Major. It’s tough; no one gives you these things."
