JOHANNESBURG - Barclays CEO Jes Staley has been fined for ordering the bank’s security team to try to identify a whistleblower. The United Kingdom’s finance regulator says he failed to act with due skill, care and diligence in a confidential draft warning notice. Following a year-long investigation, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority have each proposed that Staley pays "a financial penalty".
