AUGUSTA – American Patrick Reed and Australian Marc Leishman both opened with three straight birdies on Friday and topped the leaderboard at 5-under par as Augusta National proved tough going in the second round of the Masters. Reed's opening trio of birdies, starting with a 26-foot putt at the first hole,  actually moved him to 6-under, but he promptly gave a stroke back at the par-three fourth to stand tied with Leishman, who was 5-under through six holes. Jordan Spieth is putting together another late-round surge. He just made a lengthy birdie on No. 15 to improve to -4, just one shot behind leaders Marc Leishman and Patrick Reed. A day after Jordan Spieth birdied five straight on the back nine to seize a two-stroke first-round lead, no one was mounting a charge.

Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy, who could complete a career Grand Slam with a first Masters title, was 4-under with two to play. Tiger Woods, whose 14 major titles include four Masters crowns, started the day seven off the pace on 1-over. He opened with a bogey and dropped two more shots with a double bogey at the par-4 fifth.
