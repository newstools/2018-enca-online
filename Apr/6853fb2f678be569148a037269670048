SOWETO - Crime scene investigators are combing the perimeter near Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's house on Saturday morning. Spent cartridges could be seen on the pavement across the road from her house. Police minister Bheki Cele said it's most likely MK Veterans that left spent bullet cartridges outside Mama Winnie's home. It's a tradition they normally practice when an honoured person dies.
	
	Cele said no injuries were reported and that police are investigating. eNCA
