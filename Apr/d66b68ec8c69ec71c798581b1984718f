NEW YORK - Kyrie Irving will miss the Boston Celtics' postseason after undergoing knee surgery, ESPN reported on Thursday, dealing a potentially devastating blow to the team's playoff hopes. ESPN reporter Adrian Wojnarowski cited league sources as saying that Irving had been ruled out of the remainder of the Celtics campaign following an operation on March 24. Irving had gone under the knife last month to remove a tension wire in his left knee but was initially expected to return during the playoffs. However the 26-year-old Australian-born point guard has now been ruled out of the rest of the season, ESPN reported. There was no immediate statement from the Celtics on Irving's status.
