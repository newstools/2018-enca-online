JOHANNESBURG - Some clinics in the North West province are without antiretrovarals (ARVs) due to the ongoing strike action by the National Health, Education and Allied Workers' Union (Nehawu) members employed by the North West health department, medicine shortages monitor Stop Stock Outs said on Friday. The organisation said some health care workers reported that the available stock of medicine at clinics and hospitals could last a few days.

Immunisation of children below nine months of age has been cancelled in some clinics, due to insufficient supply. “Patient reports of stock outs have led to SSP being able to confirm that at least five clinics have closed their gates,” said SSP project manager Glenda Muzenda. She said no one was allowed to gain entry to the provincial pharmaceutical depot, meaning that medical supplies including ARVs were inaccessible.

Without ARVs, patients with HIV as well as other infections risk going untreated and those with chronic diseases risk deterioration,” she said. Muzenga called on the national department of health to work with the provincial one to find solutions of sending drugs to the facilities affected. “Thousands of lives are depending on an immediate solution to this crisis, and orders that have been placed for medicines need to be filled within the next 24 hours. We must move rapidly to ensure access to essential medicines is not compromised,” she said. Nehawu affiliated workers downed tools on February 26 demanding the dismissal of the head of department, Dr Thabo Lekalakala, termination of contracted companies by the department, bonus payments of five percent across board and an increase in the salaries of community health workers. eNCA
