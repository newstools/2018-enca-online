LONDON - Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane remains hopeful of overhauling Liverpool's Mohamed Salah in the race for Premier League Golden Boot but is also focused on helping Spurs finish the season strongly. Kane is bidding to end the campaign as the division's top scorer for the third time in a row, a feat no other player has managed since Arsenal's Thierry Henry won the last of his four scoring titles in 2006.

Liverpool have five fixtures left. "I still believe I can," Kane told British media. "Look, whatever happens, there are still games to go. I've got to focus on my game. I can't control what he (Salah) does. "Obviously as a striker, it would be great to win the Golden Boot again and I will keep working hard from now until the end of the season."

"If they (the Premier League) turn it around, they turn it around. If they take my word, they take my word. It is what it is -- the most important thing is that we won the game." Spurs next face Manchester City in the league on Saturday, before taking on Manchester United in an FA Cup semi-final on April 21. Reuters
