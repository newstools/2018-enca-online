JOHANNESBURG - The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) is to hold a memorial service for the late Winnie Madikizela-Mandela in Brandfort, Free State, on the same day as the ANC and government's official memorial service in Johannesburg. EFF leader Julius Malema says part of the reason for choosing Brandfort  - to which Madikizela-Mandela was banished for eight years - is to draw attention to the neglected museum there, which has been a bone of contention for some time. WATCH: Spotlight on Mama Winnie's house and missing millions Former Free State premier and now ANC secretary general Ace Magashule has denied any wrongdoing in the project. Millions allocated for the project since 2005 are unaccounted for. Five years ago, then President Jacob Zuma announced in his State of the Nation Address that the house would be rehabilitated and turned into a museum. However, last year it came to light that the project was in tatters. Questions about money channelled to the project for more than a decade have been met with denials and counter-accusations. eNCA
