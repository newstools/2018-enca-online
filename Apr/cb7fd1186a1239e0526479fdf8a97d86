JOHANNESBURG - Golf development in South Africa continues to run into stumbling blocks. This despite efforts by the Sunshine Tour to level the playing fields for previously disadvantaged players. Golf legend Gary Player has called for those players to toughen up if they want to make the cut in an individual sport like golf. The Gary Player Class of 2017 identified 30 golfers who were given free access to practice facilities, coaching and financial assistance to play in tournaments on the Sunshine, IGT Tour, and Big Easy Tours. Sipho Bujela was part of that group of players, but even with all that assistance, he could only manage to make just over R20,000 on tour this past season. A far cry from the almost R3-million earned by the order of merit winner, George Coetzee. *Watch the video above for the full story eNCA
