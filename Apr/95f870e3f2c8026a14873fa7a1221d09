DURBAN - A woman, believed to be in her 40s, died in hospital after three cars collided on the Hans Detman Highway near Shallcross in Durban on Saturday afternoon, paramedics said. Rescue Care paramedics arrived on the scene shortly after 3pm "to find carnage", Rescue Care spokesman Garrith Jamieson said. "Three vehicles had collided before one vehicle burst into flames and one overturned coming to rest on its side. The entire roadway was closed. One female was severely entrapped in her vehicle and in a critical condition." While firefighters worked to cut her free, advanced life support paramedics worked to stabilise her. Once freed the woman went into cardiac arrest and resuscitation efforts were started. After a short while, paramedics regained a pulse and the woman was rushed to a nearby hospital. However, she died a short while later. Her teenage son, who was also in the car, sustained moderate injuries and was also transported to a hospital. Two other drivers were also treated on the scene, with one being critically injured as a result of the fire after the crash. Both men were transported to a hospital. At this stage the events leading up to the collision were unknown, Jamieson said. African News Agency
