QUNU - The rift between the Mandela family in Qunu and Winnie Madikizela-Mandela’s family has deepened. The Mandela elders say they feel absolutely excluded by the family and have not yet decided whether they’ll take part in the funeral. One of the eldest Mandela relatives, 89-year-old Napolisi Mandela, said he only found out about Madikizela-Mandela’s death via the media. The Madikizela family representatives informed the family of her passing, but Mandela says they don’t consider Mama Winnie a member of their family since her divorce. He says the Mandela family still needs to meet to decide how they’re going to handle this situation. * Watch the full video report by Sandy McCowen in the gallery above. eNCA
