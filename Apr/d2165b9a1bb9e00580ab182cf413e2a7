MPL Magaqa was at the right place at a wrong time. These men had just gunned down four youths, before taking his car and using it to flee. "I would also like to applaud the promptness of the South African Police Services (SAPS). Magaqa’s car was later found abandoned in Dimbaza, with all valuables removed from it," Bhanga said.
