LONDON - Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero will be out of action for up to five weeks but he should be ready for the World Cup with Argentina, manager Pep Guardiola said on Friday. The 29-year-old, who has scored 21 Premier League goals for City this season, is recovering from knee surgery having not started a match for the last six weeks. When asked if Aguero’s season with City was over, Guardiola said: “Here, yeah. It’s four or five weeks (out). We will try and get him ready for the World Cup. “He is in Barcelona right now, for the first part of the rehabilitation.” READ: African stars play pivotal role in Man City title win Aguero is expected to be a key figure for Argentina, who play their opening World Cup match against Iceland on 16 June. City were crowned Premier League champions last weekend and Guardiola wants his team to break records before the end of the campaign. They could finish with the most points, most wins and most goals in a single Premier League season and the Spanish manager remains keen to keep his players motivated ahead of Sunday’s clash with Swansea City. “In the past when I won the league early at Bayern Munich and Barcelona, the next few games were not good,” Guardiola added.

It would be nice to finish good in terms of good feelings. “The important thing is to win the title but maybe the records can help us be focussed against the teams fighting to avoid relegation.” City’s opponents Swansea are currently 17th in the league and four points clear of the relegation zone with five matches to play.
