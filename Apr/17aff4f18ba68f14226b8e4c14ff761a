DURBAN - President Cyril Ramaphosa and the African National Congress (ANC) National Working Committee (NWC) were meeting in Durban on Sunday with the topic of protest-hit Mahikeng expected to feature. The NWC was meeting with 110 eThekwini branch secretaries and chairpersons at the Moses Mabhida Stadium. The meeting was set to assess the party's readiness for regional and provincial conferences. eThekwini is the ANC's biggest region, with more than 55,000 members. This week, protests in the capital of the North West Province took a violent turn as resident demanded that Premier Supra Mahumapelo be removed from his post. Mahumapelo has been shrouded in allegations of rampant corruption. He has come under fire for his relationship with the Gupta family and a R1-million bursary awarded to his son by Denel, also under scrutiny, with suspicions policy may have been bent to accommodate him. Denel denied the charge. Ramaphosa cut short a trip to the UK this week, aimed at wooing potential investors, in order to tend to the crisis in Mahikeng. He urged calm in the city, saying concerns would be addressed. The ANC said any decision on the situation in Mahikeng would be discussed by the NWC before being announced. SANDF medics have been deployed in the province to assist at hospitals and clinics crippled by a strike in the health sector.
