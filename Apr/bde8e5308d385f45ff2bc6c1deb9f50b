JOHANNESBURG - South Africa and United Kingdom have agreed to work together to promote investments in priority sectors of trade toadvance sustainable economic development in both countries. South African trade and industry minister Rob Davies and the UK secretary of state for the department for international trade, Liam Fox, who met on Tuesday, both applauded the progress made in discussions with South African Customs Union member states and Mozambique to ensure the continued economic partnership between the southern African region and the European Union once the UK exits the grouping.

"As we leave the EU and create a new independent UK trade policy, we will build further on 9 billion British pounds (R153-billion) of annual trade with South Africa, our biggest trading partner in Africa, and champion free trade to help developing countries combat poverty and grow their economies," Fox said. He said the UK would avoid any disruption to trade, while in the process of leaving the EU. Davies said the UK remained an important strategic partner for South Africa and that both countries had enjoyed mutually beneficial trade since the first reciprocal agreement between the African state and the EU in January 2000. "The UK is South Africa's second largest trading partner in the EU region. Our goods exports to the UK in 2014 were R37.6 billion and increased to R46.3 billion in 2017," he said. Davies noted that South Africa enjoyed a positive trade balance with the UK, earning the country foreign currency and helping reduce its current account deficit. South Africa's priority was to change the structure of its trade to add more value added products, he added. African News Agency
