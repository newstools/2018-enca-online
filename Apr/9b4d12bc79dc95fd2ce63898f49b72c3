JOHANNESBURG – Thousands of residents were evicted from homes in Windsor East, northwestern Johannesburg, on Tuesday due to a dispute between landlords and tenants. Streets in Windsor East were lined up with goods such as refrigerators, beds, music system, television sets and couches as the Red Ants evicted people. Residents have been accused of occupying flats in several buildings illegally. But they say they had been paying rent but were not aware their occupation was illegal.
