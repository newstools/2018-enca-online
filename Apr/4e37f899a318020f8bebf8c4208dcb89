JOHANNESBURG - Embattled Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille will seek legal advice on the DA's new recall clause. Delegates agreed to amend the party's constitution at its federal congress in Pretoria on Sunday. The amendment effectively gives the DA powers to recall elected public representatives from office. De Lille is currently fighting to clear her name within the party. She is accused of corruption and maladministration, in a hearing that' has since been postponed indefinitely. READ: DA and De Lille at each other's throats, still In a statement on Sunday, she said the newly passed "De Lille Clause" showed just how far some in the party were prepared to go. MEDIA STATEMENT:
		It is no secret that there are individuals in the DA who have been trying to get rid of me at any cost for the last few months. They've shown that they would flout their own processes and ignore their own values of 'Freedom, Fairness & Opportunity' to remove me. Changing their own Federal Constitution through the newly passed "De Lille Clause" shows just how far they are willing to go to avoid their own due process. "The DA should be aware that, even if they refuse to follow due process in the spirit of fairness, the laws of our country protect public representatives. As someone who fought for those rights during the struggle against apartheid, I will not tire in ensuring that the hearing I have asked for is open to both the media and the public," De Lille said. "They deserve to hear my defence in the interest of clearing my name in the most transparent way possible." DA leader Mmusi Maimane insists the recall clause is not targeted at individuals, and does not apply retrospectively. eNCA
