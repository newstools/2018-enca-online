VERULAM, KwaZulu-Natal - Islamic State-linked Sayufdeen Del Vecchio and Fatima Patel, believed to have masterminded the abduction of a Cape Town-based British couple, appeared in the Verulam Magistrate's Court on Thursday. They were due to make a formal bail application, but the matter was postponed for one of their co-accused to get legal representation. Del Vecchio and Patel were joined by Ahmand Jackson Mussa, also known as "Bazooka", and Thembamandla Xulu. The four have been charged with kidnapping, assault and robbery.
