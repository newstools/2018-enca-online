PRETORIA - A debate on land expropriation, hosted by the University of South Africa (Unisa) on Monday, had its fair share of heated exchanges. WATCH: Unisa land expropriation debate descends into chaos Cope leader Mosiuoa Lekota said the narrative that land was stolen is an insult to those who fought wars in South Africa. The Khoisan community is calling for Section 25 of the Constitution to be amended to make provision for a new law. The community says it's been marginalised and wants land returned to indigenous people. The audience heckled the ANC's Ronald Lomala, and the gathering degenerated into chaos, with scuffles breaking out.  Some people were escorted out of the lecture hall.

WATCH: Lekota heckled from the floor at the #LandDebate. pic.twitter.com/xilJt0eFHD Speakers expressed strong views on the contentious issue of land expropriation. #LandDebate Litchfield-Tshabala: Whites are the most spoilt people. Why should we even compensate the colonisers? Why do we tiptoe around whites? Section 25 must just be scrapped. White South Africans have a home in Europe, why don't they use it. #LandDebate Litchfield-Tshabalala: We need a national referendum to say just expropriate the land. We need these people to pay reparations. We want our land and the interest that has accrued on that land. #LandDebate Seepe: A constitution is crafted to solve challenges and if it fails to solve those problems it must be amended. Yes we may achieve something with the current constitution but any amendment must be put in a way that every claim does not end up in the courts. #LandDebate Lephakga: Blacks grabbed the empty hole in a donut while whites got the dough. There was an invasion of Azania by Europeans. eNCA
