BETHLEHEM - Free State Stars and Bloemfontein Celtic shared the spoils in an entertaining Free State derby, as they drew 1-all in an Absa Premiership match at Goble Park in Bethlehem on Saturday evening. The result was a setback for both sides with high-riding Stars looking for a top four position finish on the table, while Celtic will be eyeing a spot among the top eight clubs by the end of the league campaign. After a goalless first 45 minutes, Stars broke the deadlock in the 49th minute, when after some good build-up play, midfielder Goodman Dlamini fired into the far corner of the visitors' goal-net just wide of goalkeeper Christophe Tignyemb. The lead did not last long, with Celtic back on level terms five minutes later when Goodman Dlamini's shot on goal was kept out by Stars goalkeeper Badra Sanare, but striker Victor Letsoalo was on hand to fire home the equaliser. This was Letoalo's third goal against Stars this season, having scored twice in his team's 3-0 win over Phunya Sele Sele in first round league action in December. Stars had the better of the chances in the first half, with striker Siphelele Mthembu having squandered a superb opportunity early on, with only the goalkeeper to beat. His effort from close range rifled into the body of Celtic No 1 Christophe Tignyemb rather than into the back of the goal-net. This was the second time in as many matches that Stars have taken the lead and had to end with a 1-all draw, following their stalemate in Durban against Golden Arrows. Stars move to 39 points from 27 games, equal on points with fourth-placed Kaizer Chiefs but having played one match more. There next league outing will be when they travel to take on the Amakhosi, as Chiefs are known, next Saturday. Celtic will hold 7th spot overnight as they sit on 34 points from 27 games, and will begin planning for their next league fixture, at home to Chippa United on April 24. African News Agency
