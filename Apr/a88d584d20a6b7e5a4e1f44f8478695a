LOS ANGELES – To nobody's surprise, Avengers: Infinity War is already off to a record-breaking start. The Marvel powerhouse looks to open in North America with $250-million (R3-billion) from 4,474 locations, which would land it the highest domestic debut of all time. This number could fluctuate when an official tally comes in on Monday. That would be enough to surpass previous title holder Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which bowed with $248-million in 2015 and went on to make over $936.6-million domestically. Infinity War joins the company of The Force Awakens, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Jurassic World, The Avengers and Black Panther as one of six films in history to cross the $200-million mark in their debuts.
