GEORGE - Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema addressed a rally on land expropriation on Friday afternoon in George, Western Cape. Malema: We never said one settler one bullet, they are the ones who say they’re going to Australia. They can go they must just leave the keys to the tractors #LandExpropriation #eNCA Malema: There is no white genocide in South Africa, there’s a legitimate call for justice. They say it’s white genocide so they can prepare the world to invade SA #LandExpropriation #eNCA Earlier, a case in which he is accused of contravening the Riotous Assemblies Act by urging his supporters to invade land was postponed in the Mangaung Regional Court in Free State. In June 2016 he told supporters to occupy land because it was taken from black people by force. Earlier in the week, Malema failed to appear in the Newcastle Magistrate's Court on similar charges. He was represented by his legal team and that case was postponed again. The EFF has been alleged to have been behind a number of land grabs in the recent weeks, with community members saying their local EFF leaders had told them to seize unoccupied land. The ANC adopted a resolution last year that land should be appropriated without compensation, sparking a land-reform debate nationally.
