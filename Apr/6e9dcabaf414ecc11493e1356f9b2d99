EASTERN CAPE - Members of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's family living in Bizana are worried they won't be able to attend her funeral in Johannesburg. The struggle icon was born in the Eastern Cape town. "We came together as a family this morning and we decided to approach the local mayor and requested that we be assisted with transport. We need to go to Winnie's home, there's a formal visit that the family needs to make. Besides that there's this issue about the burial and all that," said Prince Madikizela, Winnie's cousin.

She was accepted in our family and we except that she lives in Johannesburg. But because of the kids we were prepared to accept their decision about the burial. But we want the country to understand that despite the fact that she's going to be buried in Johannesburg she belongs to us," he said. Winnie died on Monday and will be laid to rest on 14 April. eNCA
