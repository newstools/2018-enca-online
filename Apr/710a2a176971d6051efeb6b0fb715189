How could they openly write lies, coding them as truth, all in the front page? They are not different from StratCom which used 30% truth, and 70% lies to discredit anti-apartheid activists. The Sunday Times has also indulged in StratCom journalism; the only truthful thing about their report is the 30% bit that EFF attended Mama Winnie Mandela’s funeral alongside the ANC and that CIC Julius Malema was on of the speakers. The rest of the 70% of the article is speculative journalism posing as truth: by definition, it’s all false reporting,” it said in a statement. eNCA
