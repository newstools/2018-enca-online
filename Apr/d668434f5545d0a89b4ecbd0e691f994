The Blitzboks led 19-5 at the break, but a second-half fightback from the defending champion Fijians helped the side secure their spot in the final. SA’s Selvyn Davids scored a hat-trick during the encounter in which his side would ultimately come up agonisingly short. Well done to our Blitzboks in Hong Kong, making the semifinals of @OfficialHK7s where they will face Fiji. @CastleLagerSA @FNBSA @ASICS_ZA pic.twitter.com/nFyHi8hna9 The Blitzboks lead in the World Rugby Sevens Series after seven tournaments, a memorable feat considering that a number of senior players did not travel to Hong Kong in order to prepare for next weekend's Commonwealth Games Rugby Sevens.
