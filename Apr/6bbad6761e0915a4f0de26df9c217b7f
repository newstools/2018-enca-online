BOURNEMOUTH - Man's best friend may be a dog, and for dementia sufferers, even a robot dog will do. Among Ron Grantham's happiest memories are the days he spent fly-fishing with his beloved dog, Spot. Now those memories are being revived by visits from his new best friend, Biscuit - a robotic dog. Grantham is 99-years-old and lives in Templeman House, a British care home, which brought in Biscuit. Staff there say the robot dog can help to elicit memories from residents and spark conversations with care providers.

"We didn't know that before. So obviously the dog brings out memories that they can reflect on and tell us." Biscuit stands around two feet tall (around 600cm) and looks something like a labradoodle. He is equipped with sensors in various places on its body that allow him to react when a human interacts with it. Simon Bird, the deputy chief executive at Care South, which owns Templeman House and several other care homes in the south of England, said Biscuit was particularly effective at reducing stress and anxiety in residents with dementia. "When we do have residents that are getting particularly stressed or very anxious, the manager or the staff will bring Biscuit out. He's a good distraction. He reduces stress levels," Bird said. "He does stimulate memory and also encourages a lot of social interaction and recollection and reminiscence."

As resident Elsie Proctor  (94) petted Biscuit, she told the dog "You're beautiful. Yes, you are a beautiful one, yes, that's lovely." Reuters
