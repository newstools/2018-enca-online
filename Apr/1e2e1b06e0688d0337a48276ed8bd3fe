BLOEMFONTEIN - The state at the Mangaung Regional Court on Friday postponed Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Leader Julius Malema's land grab comments case. This was due to Malema's application to challenge the constitutionality of law used to charge him, the Riotous Assemblies Act, is still to be heard at the North Gauteng High Court. Malema faces charges of contravening the Riotous Assemblies Act for urging his supporters to invade land. In June 2016, he told supporters to occupy land, because it was taken from black people by force.

He was represented by his legal team and that case was postponed again.  After his brief appearance in that court in November 2016, Malema stepped outside and told his supporters to “occupy the land, because they have failed to give you the land”. #LandOccupation; fighters demonstrating at the Mangaung Regional Court.
