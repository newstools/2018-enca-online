JOHANNESBURG â€“ The Premier Soccer League on Saturday charged Kaizer Chiefs FC with misconduct and bringing the League into disrepute. BREAKING: @officialpsl charge @kaizerchiefs over #tunnelofhate a week after 30 fans threw missiles. A year after hundreds participated in #loftusriot which left 13 in hospital, @orlandopirates remain unpunished. Don't even mention #carlingcup fatalities. Kaizer Chiefs supporters threw objects onto the pitch during their Premiership fixture against Chippa United on April 7 at FNB Stadium in Johannesburg. Awful scenes at FNB Stadium right now. Kaizer Chiefs have been the target of projectiles. pic.twitter.com/CBmm1dvnFh Kaizer Chiefs will appear before the Premier Soccer League Disciplinary Committee on April 18 at 6pm. African News Agency
