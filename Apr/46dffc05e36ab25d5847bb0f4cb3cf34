BLOEMFONTEIN - Bloemfontein Celtic and Chippa United played out to a rather uneventful goalless draw in their Premiership clash at the Dr Molemela Stadium in Bloemfontein on Tuesday. Celtic's winless run stretched to four matches after they were held in a clash that will easily be forgotten by those in attendance. The home side were presented the chance to move past the Chilli Boys into seventh on the table as they look book their place in next season's MTN8. Phunya Sele Sele marginally had the better of the momentum in opening quarter with Daniel Okpayi being tested on a number of occasions, but he held firm to keep the visitors on level terms. Chippa gradually grew into the contest but could not find anything in the way of meaningful chances as the half petered out without any signs to show for a pedestrian 45 minutes. The second period started in the same manner as the first ended with little creativity being shown by either side. Out of ideas, both coaches tried to wrestle the clash with changes as Onassis Mntambo was brought on to replace Kurt Lentjies in the 76th minute before Menzi Masuku replaced Kabelo Dlamini for the home side with 10 minutes remaining. Looking for the late winner, Chippa introduced Edward Manqele and Andile Mbenyane at the expense of Mark Mayambela and Katlego Mashegobut but the elusive winner was not forthcoming. In the end, the draw was a fair reflection on the teams that can only be separated on goal difference through 28 league fixtures with the visitors moving one step closer to confirming their place in lucrative top eight.
