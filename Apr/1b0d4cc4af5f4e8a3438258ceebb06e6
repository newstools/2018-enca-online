JOHANNESBURG – Three men spent four hours drifting on the upturned hull of their boat after a wave caused it to capsize, the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) said on Saturday. The vessel, Salticrack, was reported missing on Friday morning around Sodwana Bay in KwaZulu-Natal. Skipper Etienne Fouche, an NSRI volunteer, and his two crewmen, HJ Swanepoel and F van Wyk, had been sitting on the hull since around 10:30 but became exhausted when they kept being washed off. "Noticing that they were drifting south but not getting any closer to shore, one of the men dived under the boat to recover life-jackets and they made the decision to swim to shore with their life-jackets on and the swim took them just over two hours," the NSRI said in a statement.

"They marked their position by leaving their life-jackets on the beach to attract any attention of anyone who might be searching for them and to mark where they had come ashore to give an indication of where a search should begin for their capsized craft adrift at sea," the NSRI said. "While walking northwards towards Sodwana they were located (at around 18:00) by My Lady Charters who were searching the shoreline using 4×4 vehicles."
