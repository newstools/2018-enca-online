JOHANNESBURG - ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule on Monday unveiled a tribute wall outside the party's Johannesburg headquarters in honour of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. It's one of several across the country where South Africans are encouraged to pay their respects by leaving messages of remembrance for the late struggle stalwart.

The party is encouraging mourners to inscribe their personal messages on a massive poster outside its headquarters. "The initiative is part of the party and the government's plans to allow South Africans to honour Madikizela-Mandela in a number of ways, including signing memorial books and attending night vigils," said Magashule. Madikizela-Mandela will be laid to rest on 14 April 2018. eNCA
