OSLO - Norway's R12-trillion sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, should not be given permission to invest in unlisted companies, the Nordic country's finance ministry said in recommendations to parliament on Tuesday, rejecting the fund's own advice.

"Unlisted equity investments would challenge the management model based on transparency, low management costs, and a limited degree of active management," the Finance Ministry wrote. The fund has argued that investing in unlisted shares, primarily via private equity, could help improve its balance between risk and return, naming Uber and Airbnb Inc among missed opportunities due to the current restrictions. It already has permission to take stakes in companies that have a clear intention to list, which it can still exploit, the ministry said.

"We will assess whether unlisted renewable energy infrastructure should be included in the environment-related mandates," Finance Minister Siv Jensen said in a statement. "The assessment will be based on the same requirements for transparency, return and risk that apply to other investments in the fund," she added. The sovereign wealth fund's size is equivalent to $196,000 for every Norwegian man, woman and child. Reuters
