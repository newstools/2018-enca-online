JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said on Thursday that online applications for 2019 grade one and eight pupils will open on 16 April. "We have modernised this system, it will take parents less than five minutes," said Lesufi. Lesufi said parents now had the option to choose which school they wanted their child to attend and wouldn't be forced to select certain schools based on their demographics and language. "Each parent is allowed to apply five times," explained Lesufi. READ: Gauteng online school admissions are live "Anyone who doesn't have data must go to their nearest community library."
