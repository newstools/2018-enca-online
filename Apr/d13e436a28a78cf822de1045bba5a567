JOHANNESBURG - Saftu's nationwide strike has kicked off. Saftu affiliates will be marching in major cities around the country against the national minimum wage. The union federation says the proposed national minimum wage of R20 per hour is less than the minimum living wage. The action coincides with the ongoing national bus strike that's affected commuters since 18 May. eNCA
