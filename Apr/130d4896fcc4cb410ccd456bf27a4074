JOHANNESBURG – The special Nelson Mandela Bay council sitting, during which the no-confidence vote against mayor Athol Trollip was scheduled to take place, collapsed on Tuesday. It came after opposition councillors would not stop interjecting, accusing speaker Jonathan Lawack of suspending the rules. The sitting has now been permanently adjourned. Both the UDM and the EFF want the DA's Trollip out of office. The EFF vowed to punish Trollip for his party’s stance on land expropriation without compensation, which the DA does not support.

The same motion brought two weeks ago failed to get off the ground. eNCA
