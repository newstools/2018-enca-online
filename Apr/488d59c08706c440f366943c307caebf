TZANEEN - The Balobedu tribe is celebrating the recognition of its Queenship status. In 2016, former president Jacob Zuma approved the recognition of their Queenship after it was stripped by the apartheid regime in 1972. Hundreds of villagers are expected to gather at the Mokwakwaila Stadium near Tzaneen in Limpopo to mark the historic event. President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to attend.
