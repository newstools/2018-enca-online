JOHANNESBURG - SAA has maintained its 4-star Skytrax ranking, in both its business- and economy-class cabins, despite another challenging year for the embattled airline. SAA says it received the Skytrax ranking, an independent seal of quality approval awarded for quality performance across a range of products, for the 16th consecutive year despite posting a loss of R5.67-billion for the year that ended in March 2017.
