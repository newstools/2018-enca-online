JOHANNESBURG - The North Gauteng High Court on Wednesday ordered former president Jacob Zuma to pay the legal costs of his decision to try and block the release of the former Public Protector's State of Capture report, in his personal capacity. Zuma's legal costs are estimated at over R10-million. HeÂ is still free to challenge the costs order in his personal capacity. The court also ruled that the Presidency must pay the legal costs for the withdrawal of an appeal, filed by Zuma while still in office after the court dismissed his bid to review the report. On April 6, President Cyril Ramaphosa withdrew the appeal. State attorney Isaac Chowe, for the Presidency, asked that the court make the costs order up to 6 April, reported News24. But, Judge President Dunstan Mlambo ordered that costs be paid up to the present date. eNCA
