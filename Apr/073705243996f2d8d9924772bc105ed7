Vonk continued, “We will most likely send a very young team to get experience, this is a wonderful opportunity for all the boys that will make the trip." Young Ajax finished as runners-up at the Terborg Toernooi last year. “For the boys, this tour is important for the experience. As a club, obviously we want to win and bring home two trophies, but yes for us, it is also a great opportunity to show off our talent – you never know who is watching. “Last year Leo Thethani and Dean Solomons caught the eye and they are currently at Ajax Amsterdam. It is good to put our players in the spotlight,” Vonk concluded. African News Agency
