JOHANNESBURG – A historic case involving one black man calling another black man the K-word has been postponed 24 May to allow the defence to consult with witnesses. Former MRC Media business associates and friends Fani Titi and Peter-Paul Ngwenya are locked in a court battle. It is claimed Ngwenya used the K-word on Titi in an SMS about a multi-million rand deal. Ngwenya is facing a charge for crimen injuria. Two state witnesses who worked for the Sandton-based company were called to court to testify on Wednesday. Witness Eucharist Mabena told the court Ngwenya came to the company's premises demanding to be paid. Ngwenya claims Titi owed him money from the deal worth more than R54-million involving their radio stations, Kaya, Gagasi and Heart FM.

Mabena said she was terrified by the Ngwenya's conduct. Second witness Josiel Ndlovu also corroborated Mabena's testimony, saying the accused wanted to be paid his dividends. eNCA
