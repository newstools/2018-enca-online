JOHANNESBURG - Kiernan AKA Forbes made a guest appearance from inside the wrestling ring this past weekend. American WWE hosted the sold-out two-day events at the Ticket Pro Dome in Johannesburg and the Sun Arena in Pretoria. Synonymous with wrestling, the stars in the ring often fuel the crowd with a war of words before the match. AKA went head-to-head with pro wrestler and musician Elias Samson inside the ring, dropping bars which sent the packed arena into aÂ buzz. THIS IS A MOMENT FOR THE CULTURE ... SA HIP HOP ON @WWE ... what?!?! Are you for real? if you told me that this would happen back when I was 12 years old ... I would have told you in a high pitched voice that you're out of your GOD DAMN mind.
