JOHANNESBURG – Petrol could increase by 41 cents a litre (c/l) in May, preliminary data released by the Central Energy Fund showed on Monday. Diesel is expected to jump by 48 c/l, while illuminating paraffin could rise by 38 cents on current data. This will be bad news for cash-strapped consumers, who faced an increase of 72c/l in April and a 1 percent hike in value added tax (VAT). The Automobile Association of South Africa said the hike was largely due to rising crude price, which was hovering near 2014 highs.

If the latest hikes do materialise in May, it would be the second consecutive hike in the past two months, amounting to an over R1 increase.
