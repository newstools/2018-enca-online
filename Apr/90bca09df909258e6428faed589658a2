	“We're celebrating freedom month precisely because this is the month South Africa first went to the polls. Celebrating freedom meaning acknowledging those that laid their lives (down) before we could even get the right to vote.” The minister said South Africa has made great strides since the official dawn of democracy in 1994, but she also acknowledged the country still has some way to go.
