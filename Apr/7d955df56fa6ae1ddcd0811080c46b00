Against such tough opposition, they scored 29 goals and conceded only 4 goals." School Director Stephen Fitz-Patrick said, “We were always confident we would go far in the tournament since the core of the team has been winning tournaments locally with their club Tramways since under-7 age group level.”  “However, victory on the global stage was never certain and beyond our wildest expectations. That being said all credit to the players as they put in a lot of hard work and dedication leading up to the tournament. We are most grateful to everyone that has got us here,” Fitz-Patrick said. The Mini Soccer School was established in 2011 and is open to boys and girls aged between 4-12 years of age, irrespective of their skills level. eNCA
