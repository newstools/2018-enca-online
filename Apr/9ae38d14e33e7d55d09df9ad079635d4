PARIS - A former Wall Street lawyer has decided to leave the world of finance to create a fantasyland for every child - and possibly many adults too. Nathan Sawaya created 120 superhero sculptures from Lego. The exhibition features an assortment of DC favourites like Batman, Wonder Woman and Superman. A 5,5-meter long batmobile also finds a home in an intricate batcave. Sawaya says his passion for art is why he got started. "I wanted to do something that made me happy and I wasn't happy as a lawyer. Creating art made me happy and using Lego bricks made the art very accessible,” Sawaya said. “I decided to leave the law firm behind and be a full-time artist that plays with toys."
