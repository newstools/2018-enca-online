JOHANNESBURG – The Democratic Alliance (DA) on Wednesday filed papers to have the decision to redeploy Arthur Fraser to the post of National Commissioner of Correctional Services set aside with immediate effect. This was revealed in a statement by party leader Mmusi Maimane. READ: Arthur Fraser's promotion is worrisome, says Kasrils The official opposition is seeking exclusive jurisdiction or direct access to the Constitutional Court to challenge President Cyril Ramaphosa’s decision. Fraser was implicated in state capture in investigative journalist Jacques Pauw’s book The President's Keepers. It claims Fraser was complicit in the looting of hundreds of millions of rands from a slush fund. READ: State Security Agency DG Arthur Fraser moved to Correctional Services “Fraser is a compromised individual who is wholly unfit to hold such a vital position within government and as such, the president erred in his appointment of such an individual,” the statement said. “The president’s decision to appoint Fraser falls foul of the president’s own constitutional obligations,” the party said. The DA said it had already written to Ramaphosa to no response. eNCA
