JOHANNESBURG – The South African Music Awards (Sama) said on Friday that two artists have been disqualified. The Recording Industry of South Africa  (Risa) said Tigi by Sands which was nominated in the Record of the Year category and Lake by the Ocean by Mobi Dixon which was up for Best Remix have been struck off the nominees list. “Sands is a citizen of eSwatini (formerly Swaziland) and as such is excluded from being considered for a SAMA in the Record of the Year category. Mobi Dixon’s Lake by the Ocean is a remix of an international song which is in contravention of the SAMA rules,” Sama said in a statement.
