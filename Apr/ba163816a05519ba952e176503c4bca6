JOHANNESBURG - Value Added Tax (VAT) officially goes up for the first time since the dawn of democracy on 1 April. The increase won't apply to all food items as some basic foodstuffs will be zero-rated. The hike is cited as good for economic growth and is aimed at boosting the public purse, but civil society and trade unions are not convinced. The Federation of Unions of South Africa (Fedusa) says the VAT increase will hit the poor hardest. *View the attached video for more on the VAT increase eNCA
