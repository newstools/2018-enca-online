CAPE TOWN - South Africa rounded off day six of the 2018 Commonwealth Games on Australia's Gold Coast in superb style to raise their gold medal tally to nine. The overall total from the games now stands at 21. It is still a far cry off from the 40 medals Mzanzi won at Glasgow 2014, but with five days still to go, there are hopes that more medals could come in. The tournament ends on Sunday. Swimmer Chad le Clos has been the stand-out South African with a personal haul of five medals, including three gold, a silver and a bronze.  There are a few other local swimmers who also finished up on Tuesday as multi-medallists.  Champion breaststroker Tatjana Schoenmaker is next best with two golds. Cameron van der Burgh had three, including one gold and two bronze medals. Bradley Tandy has a silver and a bronze with Ryan Coetzee bagging two bronze.
