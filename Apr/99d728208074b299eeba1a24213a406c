PRETORIA - Former NPA head Bulelani Ngcuka said Jacob Zuma’s prosecution was not a personal matter. Ngcuka was speaking on the sidelines of a memorial service to honour late ANC veteran Zola Skweyiya.
	
	In 2003, Ngcuka controversially declared that his team had evidence of corruption against Zuma, but that a case would be unwinnable and  he had therefore decided not to charge the then deputy president. READ: 'Ngcuka ultimately decided when Zuma should be charged' - NPA Nguka said that, at the time,he was simply doing his job as head of the NPA. “I have made the point, that I derived no pleasure from the prosecution of Mr Zuma," said Ngcuka. "There’s nothing personal between me and him. I was doing my job and that is done now. And I’m not commenting further about this matter. "I’m not going to comment today, not tomorrow or anytime in the future. The NPA are the ones who must comment on this matter, I’m not the NPA,” Ngcuka said. Last month, current NPA boss Shaun Abrahams decided to proceed with charges of corruption, money laundering and racketeering against Zuma. eNCA
