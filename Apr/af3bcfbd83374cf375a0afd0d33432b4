JOHANNESBURG - Twitter users were conflicted on Wednesday about whether or not to feel sorry for Khloe Kardashian in light of revelations that her boyfriend has been cheating on her while she is pregnant. Entertainment website TMZ  published surveillance footage of Kardashian's boyfriend, Tristan Thompson, in a hookah lounge outside Washington DC with two women. He kisses one of them. Hot on the heels of TMZ's report, theshaderoom.com published more footage of him entering a hotel with one of the women he was seen with in the surveillance video. In 2016, Thompson, a basketball player, left his pregnant girlfriend, Jordan ‘Jordy C’ Craig, to be with Kardashian  - he didn’t even show up at Craig's baby shower. Craig posted a response on Instagram on the latest saga, calling for mutual respect.  Blogger Perez Hilton posted an article saying Thompson is a "serial cheater" and that his friends are not surprised at the latest revelations. Twitter has echoed this sentiment, with users split between sympathy for Kardashian and feeling that there is a sense of karma at play. eNCA
