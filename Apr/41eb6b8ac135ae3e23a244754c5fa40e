JOHANNESBURG - ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule says the Free State government has done much to honour Winnie Madikizela-Mandela that the media does not know about. Magasule was visiting the family of slain apartheid-era teen activist Stompie Seipei on Sunday when eNCA's Samkele Maseko asked if he was not embarrassed about Mama Winnie's Brandfort home. Madikizela-Mandela spent eight years in the Free State house after being banished to the town by the apartheidÂ regime in 19-77. The Free State government was meant to renovate and turn the house into a museum but has so far only a barbed-wire fence has been erected.
