JOHANNESBURG - Legal firms representing different parties seeking a class action lawsuit against Tiger Brands over the deadly listeriosis outbreak are to join forces. The total claim against Tiger Brands now stands at around R400 million. [BREAKING] #Listeriosis The two attorney firms that took class action lawsuit applications to the South Gauteng High Court over damages, injury and death from #ListeriosisOutbreak have in principle reached an agreement to consolidate the actions in the interest of class members. In March, ten applicants approached the South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg to sue companies for the deaths and other damages as a result of the deadly outbreak. The ten applicants subsequently filed a class action lawsuit. Earlier in April, Tiger Brands indicated it would oppose the two applications where it and its subsidiary, Enterprise Foods, are the respondents.
