JOHANNESBURG – The government wants a three-week delay to public sector wage talks. Negotiations began in October, but parties seem no closer to reaching an agreement. READ: Where are the rand and interest rates headed? The government wants to control its bloated public service wage bill, while unions are pushing for above-inflation increases. The Public Servants Association says the last offer from the employer, tabled in January, fell short of workers’ demands. Unions want an increase of three percent above inflation for the lower-level workers and inflation plus two percent for mid-level workers. eNCA
