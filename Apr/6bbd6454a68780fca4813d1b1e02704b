The airline says it is aggressively implementing its turnaround plan and its leadership will drive implementation of the strategy. “The urgency to bring skills into SAA to stabilise leadership cannot be overemphasised,” said SAA CEO Vuyani Jarana. “We have always maintained that we will adopt a three-pronged strategy to bring skills into SAA. “These include searching for experienced executives to fill vacancies on a permanent basis, appointing interim executives with experience to fill the gaps whilst searching for permanent executives as well as engaging industry firms to bring capacity at short notice to industrialise our turnaround interventions. “Filling the critical skills gap is top priority, especially in the financial, business and commercial specialist areas of the airline.” eNCA
