SEDIBENG – Farmworkers are living in fear as they face eviction in Tweefontein, south of Johannesburg. They were told by a farmer to vacate their homes last month after the property was sold. Some workers have been living and working on the farm for over 50 years. This comes at a time when South Africa is in the throes of trying to address land reform. EXPLAINER: Issues, risks involved in expropriating land A weeping Dorah Mofokeng (75) told eNCA she has nowhere to go. “We are asking the farmer to leave us alone, especially me, because there is nowhere I can go. He must leave me alone to die here because I have nowhere to go,” she said. Mofokeng is also worried about the graves on the farm where nine of her family members are buried.

The old (former) farmer told me to stay here and relax and later he told them that his son is selling the farm. The new farmer must come and answer their questions," said another of the farmworkers, Martha Mohoge. “Where is God? We are like children of Israel but they are suffering. They are looking for a place to stay and they want freedom because we are still oppressed and enough is enough, this land is theirs,” said Sarah Seba, who is also being evicted.

	“It’s very sad that we still have such a problem in our country where white people remove black people in their farms. It is their farms too they belong here,” said community activist, Themba Mnisi. eNCA tried to obtain comment from the new farmer but no one appeared willing to open the gate to the property. eNCA
