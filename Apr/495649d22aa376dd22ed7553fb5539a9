PARLIAMENT - An investigation into an alleged conspiracy to defraud the South African Police Service’s (SAPS) Crime Intelligence Unit to pay for votes during the African National Congress (ANC) elective conference in December has stalled, a spokesperson for the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) said on Friday. Speaking at the sidelines of a briefing to Parliament's Portfolio Committee on Police, Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) spokesperson Moses Dlamini said they're waiting for national police commissioner Khehla Sitole to approve a request for the declassification of documents related to the probe. "We have approached him to ask for declassification of certain documentation and information. We are still waiting for that to happen. Once that happens, that will give us more information...," Dlamini added.

In February, Ipid said it was probing a case of fraud and corruption of approximately R45 million related to the buying of votes at the ANC conference. It is alleged a plan was concocted to procure a grabber [communication interception device], which the watchdog believes "normally costs between R7million and R10m". Dlamini said the investigation is being conducted in collaboration with the Inspector-general of intelligence, adding Sitole was dutybound to hand over information related to their investigation. "He is required by law to cooperate with the investigation...when sufficient time has passed, we will consider how to move on with the investigation if we don't get this documentation declassified." On Wednesday, Sitole told the police committee he was not aware that he was under investigation by Ipid after footage emerged of a meeting between a supplier, a ministerial advisor, Sitole and other senior officials on 13 December 2017. Dlamini confirmed this. "At this stage, we haven't identified any specific suspects," said Dlamini.

"To be quite honest here, police protect each other. They function like a gang. We call it the blue curtain because what goes on behind the blue curtain is beyond us...and you will see as more and more of these cases emerge... racketeering is the way things are done," McBride said. "For many years, at least post-1994, the corruption has not been detected. No one looked at it. The counter-intelligence division of crime intelligence was unable to pick it up." The will to identify corruption is not there in the leadership of SAPS," said McBride. African News Agency
