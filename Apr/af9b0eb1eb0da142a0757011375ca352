JOHANNESBURG - The DA’s Cape Town caucus will debate the future of embattled Mayor Patricia de Lille’s later on Wednesday. The party's federal executive gave the caucus the go-ahead to invoke its recall clause. The caucus will meet at 5pm to decide on De Lille’s fate. WATCH: DA gets another shot at De Lille no-confidence vote If it votes to recall her, De Lille will be asked to provide the federal executive with reasons why she should be allowed to remain in her position. If the party's national leadership confirms the caucus’s decision, she will have two days to vacate office. De Lille has called the DA's new recall clause a witch hunt against her. She is facing DA disciplinary proceedings for alleged corruption and bringing the party into disrepute. eNCA
