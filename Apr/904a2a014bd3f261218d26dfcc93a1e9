RUSTENBURG – Bottom-of-the-log Platinum Stars snapped an 11-match winless streak, to beat Polokwane City 2-0 in an Absa Premiership match played at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium near Rustenburg on Saturday evening. Stars, who have gone 7 losses and 3 draws in the league plus a Nedbank Cup exit to Baroka, since their last triumph (against Wits on December 16 last year), finally got their first win of 2018, when striker Bongi Ntuli headed home past City goalkeeper George Chigova from a free-kick, in the 75th minute. With City pushing hard for the equaliser, Stars substitute Gerald Phiri managed to make some headway into the visitors'danger zone as he beat a few defenders before slotting the ball home wide of Chigova late into second-half stoppage time. The goals will have eased the blood pressure of Stars coach Roger de Sa who have had reason to feel hard done by after his side was not awarded a penalty in the 63rd minute when the ball seemed to hit the hand of City defender Thapelo Tshilo in the visitor's penalty area.

City, in 13th spot on the league table with 30 points from 26 games, are one of the limbo sides where another loss could throw them close within range of the relegation tussle, but a win might push them among the top eight clubs. The side from Limpopo will host league champions Wits in their next league match next week. African News Agency
