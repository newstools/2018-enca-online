JOHANNESBURG - Former safety and security minister Sydney Mufamadi says the controversial Winnie Madikizela-Mandela documentary "Winnie" is one-sided. The award-winning documentary was first aired publicly in South Africa after Madikizela-Mandela's death. It drew an outcry after it showed that a propaganda plan was hatched allegedly by some in Madikizela-Mandela's beloved ANC, apartheid government leaders and journalists to weaken her politically. Mufamadi gave his side of the story on Monday after damning allegations in the documentary that he sought to implicate the late struggle veteran in the murder of teen activist Stompie Seipei. He said the filmmaker, Pascale Lamche,  had never given him a chance to give his side of the story. "You make five chilling revelations about people who are still alive and still available. You don't think they have a right to ensure that they put forward a version which may corroborate what other people are saying or which may need to be compared to what others are saying, which would have been a fair thing to do,” Mufamadi said during a media briefing in Johannesburg. “This is a right I will promote and defend even if the victim is not myself."

"Why does this doccie feel it’s enough to have [Henk] Hesslinga, McPherson and [Paul] Erasmus to tell the story and life of Winnie Mandela? “It's not material to the issue." eNCA
