JOHANNESBURG – It has been more than a month since former South African National Defence Force (Sandf) colonel William Endley was sentenced to death in South Sudan. The 55-year-old was charged with espionage and conspiring to overthrow the government. The South African was hired in 2016 to advise former vice president and rebel leader Riek Machar on the planned integration of rebel forces into the national army under the then peace deal.

Endley's sister, Charmaine Quinn, said an appeal against the “gravely unfair” charges was lodged on 4 March. Quinn said she also wrote to South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and Department of International Relations and Cooperation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu to try and get the government to see the injustice of this sentence. She said she had not heard anything regarding the appeal and said the process could take up to two years to complete.

Endley, who can appeal the ruling, was also sentenced to nine years and four months in prison for other related crimes, which must be served before his execution. * Additional reporting by AFP. eNCA
