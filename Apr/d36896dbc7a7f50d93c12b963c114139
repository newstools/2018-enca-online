JOHANNESBURG - Former Paralympian Oscar Pistorius’ bid to appeal his 13-year murder sentence has been dismissed. The Constitutional Court said the appeal does not engage the court’s jurisdiction. LISTEN: Pistorius injured in prison brawl over use of public phone In November, the Supreme Court of Appeal extended his sentence from six to 13-years for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. He was originally convicted of culpable homicide in 2014 by Judge Thokozile Masipa. The conviction was upgraded to murder in 2015. But, the National Prosecuting Authority appealed the high court's sentence arguing that six years was shockingly lenient. eNCA
