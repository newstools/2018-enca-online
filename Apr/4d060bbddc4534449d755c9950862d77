MUNICH - Zinedine Zidane left out both Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema from Real Madrid's starting line-up for Wednesday's Champions League semi-final first leg at Bayern Munich. The holders started with Isco and Lucas Vazquez either side of Cristiano Ronaldo. Having already left Benzema on the bench for the quarter-final second leg against Juventus, Real coach Zidane dropped Bale as well. Captain Sergio Ramos returned to Real's starting line-up after missing the dramatic return game with Juve through suspension. There were no such surprises in the Bayern line-up. James Rodriguez, who is on loan from Real, started for the Germans against his parent club with midfielder Thiago Alcantara left on the bench. Set-piece expert David Alaba failed to recover from a thigh injury and Rafinha took his place at left-back. Bayern head coach Jupp Heynckes opted for experience on the wings in Arjen Robben, 34, and Franck Ribery, 35, playing out wide with Robert Lewandowski through the middle.
