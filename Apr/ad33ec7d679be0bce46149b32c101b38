JOHANNESBURG - The IAAF issued new eligibility regulations for female athletes competing in the 400m to 1,500 m distances. Athletes must take medication to lower testosterone levels in order to participate in races. South Africa’s Caster Semenya will be forced to take daily testosterone-lowering medication if she intends to continue competing in 400m to 1500m races. The new requirements come into effect on 1 November. “We want athletes to be incentivised to make the huge commitment and sacrifice required to excel in the sport, and to inspire new generations to join the sport and aspire to the same excellence,” said IAAF president Sebastian Coe.
