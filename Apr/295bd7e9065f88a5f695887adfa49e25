JOHANNESBURG – The Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) has condemned a shooting incident that took place outside the home of late struggle stalwart Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. Crime scene investigators combed the perimeter near the house on Saturday morning. Spent cartridges could be seen on the pavement across the road from her house.
