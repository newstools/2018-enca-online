JOHANNESBURG – A preliminary report by the Department of Transport on Tuesday showed male drivers were three times more likely to be reckless than their female counterparts. Transport Minister Blade Nzimande revealed the 2018 preliminary Easter road safety report. It showed male drivers accounted for 71,1 percent of fatalities, compared to female counterparts who contributed 24,1 percent. The department further said human factor contributed to 89,5 percent to the crashes, compared to 75,3 percent in 2017. Nzimande said the country needed harsher laws when it came to drunk driving. "We need further detail analysis… There is speeding, there’s drunk driving. Drunken driving needs to be treated as a more serious offence in terms of the law. We need to say, you won’t get bail for a week. You are going to stay in prison."

What do we do about pedestrians, who are half of road fatalities? It [deadly crashes] occur around taverns and malls. We need community mobilisation and education. Working with councellors at local level, we need to increase road safety awareness,” the minister added. eNCA
