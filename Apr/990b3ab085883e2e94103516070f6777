JOHANNESBURG – Trade union Numsa called on its members to take part in the strike organised by the South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu). They say the suggested minimum wage is a continuation of racism and should be scrapped. Numsa General Secretary, Irvin Jim said some of their members are being threatened not to take part in the strike. He said those against the strike must remember that workers have a constitutional right to take part. Unions are embarking on a national strike on Wednesday demanding that the national minimum wage not be implemented.

The Federation of Unions of South Africa (Fedusa), however, said it “totally rejects calls by the Saftu leadership to join it in a self-serving nationwide strike planned for tomorrow against the National Minimum Wage.” It added that it supports the minimum wage. eNCA
