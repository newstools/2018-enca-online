JOHANNESBURG - The head of the State Capture Inquiry, Raymond Zondo, has dismissed an Economic Freedom Fighters' objection to the appointment of former Auditor-General Terence Nombembe as investigations head. 
	
	Soon after the appointment of the inquiry team the EFF accused Nombembe of accepting a million-rand donation from Gupta-linked company Trillian. The party said this showed a conflict of interest on Nombembe's part and demanded his removal. READ: Zondo starting on wrong footing, says Malema But Zondo says there's no evidence Nombembe received the money. Zondo found that the money was meant for a bursary scheme donation. But it was returned to Trillian after damning allegations of the company's role in state capture. eNCA
