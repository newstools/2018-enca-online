"We are asking that the 2022 World Cup be played with 48 teams," Dominguez said. Five CONMEBOL teams -- Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Colombia and Peru -- will go to this year's World Cup in Russia. Under the existing qualifying system, four South American countries qualify automatically with the fifth having to come through a two-legged play-off. For this year's World Cup Peru beat Oceania's top side New Zealand to make it to Russia. The new 48-team format will give South America six places, with a seventh side going into an intercontinental play-off. AFP
