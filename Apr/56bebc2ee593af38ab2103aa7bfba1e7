JOHANNESBURG - Cricket South Africa (CSA) and the South African Cricketers’ Association (SACA) ON Thursday announced an interim agreement had been reached that would see cricketers receiving a 6 percent pay increase and a share of revenue generated by the sport in future. In a statement, CSA said the interim agreement would apply until a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) had been finalised, with 30 June 2018 set as a target date for finalisation. Under the interim agreement, players receive a 6 percent increase at national and franchise level, effective 1 May. CSA committed to maintaining a revenue share model with the players, details of which would be finalised as part of the MOU.

	It says CSA and SACA committed to negotiating a new long-term commercial rights agreement to apply from 1 July 2018. The MOU is envisioned to establish remuneration guidelines for the next four to five years. “We are satisfied that this interim agreement addresses the uncertainty that has existed amongst players regarding the MOU and their contracts, and it ensures that no national or franchise player in the system going forward is left without a contract come 1 May 2018,” SACA chief executive Tony Irish said. “There is still a long way to go in these negotiations but CSA and SACA have both acted in the best interests of the game by setting a clear platform needed to jointly and constructively get this done within a two-month period,” CSA acting chief executive Thabang Moroe said. eNCA
