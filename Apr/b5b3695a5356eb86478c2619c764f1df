We've organized obviously major marches in Durban, Johannesburg, Cape Town, PE and KZN. We are calling on workers to come out in their numbers. We know it’s going to be a huge challenge for buses that are on strike but we have laid out trains in Gauteng, we've paid for them. They can get all other means of transport including taxi's to join the strikes and we've quite happy with the levels of support we've getting from unions outside saftu", said Zwelinzima Vavi, South African Federation of Trade Unions. eNCA
