JOHANNESBURG - Kaizer Chiefs are determined to finish third on the Premiership log according to influential playmaker Bernard Parker. With two matches remaining in the season, Chiefs are fourth on 42 points, one point behind third-placed Maritzburg United. The two teams will clash at FNB Stadium on Saturday, and a win for either side could well determine the third spot on the log.

Chiefs lost against Golden Arrows on Tuesday, and that result would have come as a heavy blow for the Soweto Giants. “We have been knocked hard,” Parker admits. “We need to reset ourselves mentally. It’s a big challenge as a footballer. We have to be mentally strong and stick together.” “We want to win the final two matches of the season because we want to finish in a good frame of mind.” African News Agency
