CAPE TOWN - Dutch investors still do not know what will happen to the millions they have invested in embattled retailer Steinhoff International. They attended the retailer’s Annual General Meeting (AGM) in the Netherlands on Friday to get a better understanding of what is happening at the company. But their hopes of light being shed on investigations into Steinhoff’s financial irregularities were dashed. One of the investors, the Dutch Investors Association, said the AGM was "a sealed-lipped exercise." The association’s Armand Kersten said: "They invoked their integrity towards serving the interests of the stakeholders. We are firmly of the belief that they take joint responsibility for what has occurred on their boards." WATCH: Steinhoff AGM leaves shareholders in the dark Kersten said former Chief Executive Officer Markus Jooste had been proved to be a crook "and plenty of the other board members were not. But still, we believe it’s not good enough to say, well, we weren’t there and we weren’t presiding over what occurred. That, to us, sounds way too passive." He says one concern for investors is the role of auditing firm Deloitte, which will be retained as auditors until September this year. "We believe that they have very disappointingly failed in their duties and obligations as the auditors to the company. We find it staggering that on the statements and disclosures, it looked as if they stumbled upon the irregularities." The Dutch Investors Association is just one of many that are now taking legal action against Steinhoff. The company also faces legal action from countries like Germany. Many investors are awaiting audited financial statements from Steinhoff, set for release in January 2019. eNCA
