JOHANNESBURG â€“ There is reason to believe VBS Mutual Bank was engaged in fraudulent reporting and manipulation of financial information, according to SA Reserve Bank deputy governor Kuben Naidoo. Naidoo was referring to the initial findings of an assessment presented to the central bank by VBS curator Sizwe Ntsaluba Gobodo. The bank filed an affidavit last week relating to a court application initially launched by VBS's majority shareholder, Vele Investments.

VBS shot to prominence after it extended former president Jacob Zuma a loan to repay the state for improvements to his Nkandla home. The bank was placed under curatorship last month. eNCA
