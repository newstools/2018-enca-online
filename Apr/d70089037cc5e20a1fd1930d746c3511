		This weekend, we make history pic.twitter.com/82SlgtVPgH It's being touted as one of the most important in the party's history. Racial quotas have been the focal point of discussions ahead of the congress. READ: Stage set for ‘most important congress in DA’s history’ Party leader Mmusi Maimane is adamant the DA must be representative of the country's demographics. But some DA leaders have opposed the move. The party's Chief Whip John Steenhuisen has written a letter calling for the scrapping of a proposal to extend Maimane's tenure by two years. Another issue the DA's like to likely to discuss is the disciplinary process involving Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille.
