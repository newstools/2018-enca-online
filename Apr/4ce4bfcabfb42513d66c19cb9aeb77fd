The province’s capital city, Mahikeng, was the hotbed of protests motivated by lack of service delivery. Calm has returned to the city after residents ended their three-day long protest on Saturday following pleas from President Cyril Ramaphosa. “It is still quiet in Mahikeng, the only thing right now is that some children are not going to school but the bus strike can also be a factor,” Mokgwabone said. eNCA
