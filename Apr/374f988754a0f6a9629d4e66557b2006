JOHANNESBURG – The controversial Gupta family have been in the headlines recently for all the wrong reasons with officials seizing assets in a raid on their Saxonwold home on Monday. The Asset Forfeiture Unit (AFU), South African Revenue Services (Sars) along with the Hawks and the South African Police Services (Sars) were involved in the operation. Last week, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) obtained a restraining order to seize assets belonging to the Indian brothers for their role in the Estina Dairy Farm project. The farm, meant to benefit black farmers, was instead used to syphon funds from the state through the flouting of procedural rules.
