JOHANNESBURG - Kagiso Rabada, the world's number one Test bowler, will miss the Indian Premier League season due to a back injury, Cricket South Africa said on Thursday. He had been contracted to the Delhi Daredevils for the annual Twenty20 league, which begins this weekend. The national cricket body said Rabada had been ruled out of action for three months with what it described as a "lower back stress reaction". Rabada was man of the series in South Africa's 3-1 Test series win over Australia despite struggling with stiffness of the lower back during the fourth Test, which ended in Johannesburg on Tuesday.

READ: Rabada regains top ranking Test bowler slot "He will need a month's break from all physical activity before commencing with a rehabilitation programme," said team manager Dr Mohammed Moosajee said: Moosajee said the aim was to get Rabada ready for South Africa's three-format tour of Sri Lanka in July. Rabada, 22, has had a remarkable rise to the top of world cricket, but there has been concern about his heavy workload.
