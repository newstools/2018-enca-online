BRITAIN –  Tottenham Hotspur were held to a 1-1 draw at Brighton & Hove Albion on Tuesday, giving fresh hope to Chelsea in the battle for a Premier League top-four finish while edging the hosts further away from the relegation zone. A tame encounter sprung to life early in the second half when England forward Harry Kane fired Tottenham ahead with his 26th league goal of the season, but the advantage was short-lived as Brighton won a penalty within seconds of the restart.
