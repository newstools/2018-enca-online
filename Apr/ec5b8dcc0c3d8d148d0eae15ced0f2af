JOHANNESBURG - Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois and his father, Thierry, have initiated legal action against Marc Wilmots after the former Belgium manager accused them of leaking team-election information. Former Belgian coach Wilmots: I had a problem in Euro 2016, I was telling the players about the lineup at 6:00, and 15 minutes later, you find it on websites. That means we had a rat in dressing room. French journalists told me that Courtoisâ€™s father was telling them. Shame. #CFC pic.twitter.com/YeBvR9kp1Y Wilmots had told beIN Sports in an interview that he was informed Thierry sold Belgium's team news to journalists during the 2016 European Championships.  The 49-year-old was sacked following his team's surprise defeat by Wales in the quarter-finals of the tournament. READ: Chelsea not in crisis, says Giroud "Wilmots - not for the first time - reiterates publicly and intentionally accusations against my honour and reputation as well as [that of] my father," Courtois said on social media. "We decided together to file a complaint accompanied by criminal indemnification proceedings for libel and defamation." Courtois and Wilmots also had a public falling out with the goalkeeper criticising Belgium's tactics during the Euro 2016. Reuters
