JOHANNESBURG – Friday's classes have been suspended at the North West University (NWU) due to ongoing political unrests in Mahikeng. “Due to the  Mafikeng strike, there will be no classes tomorrow. All planned events are postponed. Further updates over the weekend. Please be safe. Avoid public spaces,” the University announced through Twitter. Widespread unrests in the city had already disrupted academic plans on Thursday forcing the campus to shut down. “As a result of widespread unrest in Mahikeng, allegedly related to service delivery, the campus has been closed for today for the safety of all NWU staff and students,” the University had announced earlier on the day.
