Rapper Rouge is nominated for Music Video of the Year for Arumtumtum and for Best Hip Hop Album, the first woman ever nominated in this category. Was gigging last night and I find out that I've been nominated for 2 SAMAs already.... First woman to ever be nominated for best hiphop ---------- god is so good!!! Lets bring it home! She is up against Riky Rick, Shane Eagle, Emtee and Fresh 2 Def Production for best hip-hip-album. All jokes aside, Its a privilege and blessing to be nominated for @thesamas . Ive been making music for 15 years, dropped my first mixtape 11 years ago. Been through the ups and downs the past 5 years. Still being included after everything feels good. Thank you everybody. ---- pic.twitter.com/2wObIwm6Xi Mafikizolo received the most nominations, three, for Best Afro Pop Album, Best Engineered Album and Best Produced Album for 20.

With or without a #SAMA nomination, we all know whose album was the best in 2017. #Thuto
		Recognized by an international OG@MCHammer @CassperNyovest pic.twitter.com/hiAw2bK8Xi I support @CassperNyovest decision for not submitting Thuto for the SAMA’s. There is just so much corruption and politics going on there, We over that, our focus is making good music for the fans. #TeamNyovest Ladysmith Black Mambazo.
