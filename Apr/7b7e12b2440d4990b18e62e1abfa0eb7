TOKYO - Nintendo's annual net profit soared 36.1 percent, thanks to the immense popularity of its Switch console, the company said on Thursday. It announced it was appointing a new president, Shuntaro Furukawa, 46, who currently oversees marketing and other divisions at the Kyoto-based video game giant. He will succeed 68-old-year Tatsumi Kimishima, who has headed up the firm since 2015. Nintendo has been on a winning streak, with its Switch console flying off the shelves since its launch last year.
