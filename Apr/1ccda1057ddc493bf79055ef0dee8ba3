JOHANNESBURG – Bloemfontein Celtic’s Ndumiso Mabena appeared unable to keep his eyes off his opponents when he was caught taking in a briefing of his old teammates at Pirates. In a short video clip, the striker is seen focusing intently on what the Pirates assistant coach is telling his players during a water break. Rhulani Mokoena is seen holding a planning board and dishing out instructions to his players. Mabena appears very interested in what Mokoena is saying. READ: Celtic skipper Brown granted testimonial honour Towards the end of the clip, Celtics coach Vaselin Jelusic seems to try to communicate with Mabena, but it is unclear what he is saying to his forward player. In the end, whatever Mabena was fishing for did not work: Pirates went on to win the match 2-1 and keet the pressure on runaway leaders Mamelodi Sundowns. Ndumiso Mabena Do you think Vaselin Jelusic is calling him to ask about @orlandopirates tactics or to get him out of the opponent's technical area? pic.twitter.com/xCAAXaOraw eNCA
