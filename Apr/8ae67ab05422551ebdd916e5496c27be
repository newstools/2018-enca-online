JOHANNESBURG – An unlikely Twitter star, in the form of an MEC, has emerged at one of the memorial services in the Eastern Cape for late struggle veteran Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. The 81-year-old passed away at Johannesburg’s Milpark Hospital on 2 April after a long illness. READ: Winnie Madikizela-Mandela dies There have been many services countrywide to celebrate the life of one of the most prominent female faces of the liberation struggle. Social media has been in stitches with Eastern Cape Sports MEC Pemmy Majodina’s reaction during a ceremony in Bizana – the former struggle veteran's homestead.

In the next clip, Majodina could be seen trying her hand at ‘sign language’.
