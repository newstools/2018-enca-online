JOHANNESBURG – The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) is counting on the Democratic Alliance (DA) and possibly the Freedom Front Plus (FF+) to oust North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo. The premier faces a motion of no confidence in the legislature on Tuesday morning. The motion was lodged by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). Mahumapelo is faced with widespread accusations of fraud and corruption in the province. “I must indicate to you, as you may be aware, that there have been so many scandals… Supra, he's implicated in so many scandals,” the EFF’s Betty Diale said. “He's the leader of the province. If departments are found to be scandalised and corrupt, as it is now, we have no choice as the EFF because we are a corrupt-free organisation. It's our responsibility to root out corruption.” READ: DA to lay charges against Mahumapelo, Denel boss over bursary claims Diale says it has been a difficult task engaging with other party’s to stand in their corner. “We haven't given up on them, but we are still engaging the Freedom Front Plus… They have one member in the legislature, we are still engaging the member. We are not as confident as we are with the DA, of course, but we haven't given up on the member. “We are trying to show him why he should vote with the motion. Surely, he's also complaining about the corruption in the province. He has the responsibility to do the right thing and vote with us,” Diale added. eNCA
