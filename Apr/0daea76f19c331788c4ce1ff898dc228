JOHANNESBURG - Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Lindiwe Sisulu has "noted and welcomed" the retraction by Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Foreign Minister Jullie Bishop of the comments made by their Home Affairs minister on the land redistribution process. According to a statement released on Monday by the International Relations and Cooperation (Dirco): “We welcome the assurance by the Australian government, as reported in the media, that the comments made by their Home Affairs minister are not in line with Australian immigration policy. "We also welcome Australia's condemnation of the unfortunate comments by South African and other international organisations and leaders," Sisulu said. Last month, Sisulu officially informed the Australian government that its South African counterpart was offended by comments made by that country's minister of Home Affairs, Peter Dutton.
