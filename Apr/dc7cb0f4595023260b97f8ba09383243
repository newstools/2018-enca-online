JOHANNESBURG - South Africa's pharmacy, health and beauty retailer, Clicks Group, on Thursday reported a 10 percent increase in turnover to R14.4-billion in the six months to February 2018 as the retailer generated cash inflows from operations of over R1.1-billion. The group’s performance for the half-year resulted in diluted headline earnings per share (HEPS) increasing by 14.8 percent to 266.3 cents, and interim dividend was increased by 16.5 percent to 102.5 cents per share, up from 88.0 cents per share in 2017. Clicks expanded its store footprint to 646 with the opening of 24 stores in the past six months while ClubCard active membership increased to 7.5 million as the loyalty programme attracted close to 950,000 new customers in the past year. Chief executive David Kneale said that health and beauty sales rose by 14.3 percent, which contributed to Clicks gaining market share in all product categories. Kneale said that the growth was driven mainly by buoyant Christmas trading, appealing promotional offers and competitive pricing. "The core health and beauty markets in which we operate are resilient and our market-leading brands are well positioned to increase market share in the current environment," Kneale said. "We expect Clicks to continue its growth momentum and the chain will be opening 40 new stores this year, well ahead of the target of 25 to 30 stores." Kneale said the group is investing over R700-million on new stores, pharmacies, store refurbishments, supply chain infrastructure and IT this year.
