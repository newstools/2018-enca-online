"I remembered when I was called in for an interview that was on 1 November 2007. When I walked in she looked at me and said: 'I love your outfit. How did you match these colours? When we got into the office we talked about clothes, she asked me who my designer was, as if I had a designer. I had to say: 'I have someone who makes my clothes and this person is very perfect.' And that's all we talked about that day."
