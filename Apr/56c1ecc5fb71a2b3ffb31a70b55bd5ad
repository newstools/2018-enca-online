JOHANNESBURG - Zodwa Zwane, the personal assistant of Winnie Madikizela Mandela, spoke emotionally about uMama'sÂ suffering on Wednesday. Zwane said she had told Madikizel-Mandela: "sometimes you feel lonely in the midst of people because people that you love will not be there."\ Zwane recalled her first meeting with the woman she considered a "mother, friend and boss". "I remembered when I was called in for an interview that was on 1 November 2007. When I walked in she looked at me and said: 'I love your outfit. How did you match these colours? When we got into the office we talked about clothes, she asked me who my designer was, as if I had a designer. I had to say: 'I have someone who makes my clothes and this person is very perfect.' And that's all we talked about that day." WATCH: Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's great-grandchildren pay tribute to her Zwane said Easter Monday would never be the same. eNCA
