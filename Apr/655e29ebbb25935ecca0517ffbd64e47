JOHANNESBURG - The Railway Safety Regulator (RSR) is investigating the deadly collision between a train and bakkie at a railway level crossing at Buttskop, in the Western Cape on Friday. The regulator dispatched inspectors to the scene to conduct a preliminary investigation and to establish the root cause of the accident. The seven occupants of the bakkie were all killed. pic.twitter.com/vwIvLuQDpH "The bakkie was following a taxi on Frederick Road, parallel to the railway track approaching the Buttskop Level Crossing. As the train was approaching the crossing, the taxi drove across and the bakkie followed the taxi but was unfortunately hit by the train. The level crossing is protected by boom gates and flashing lights," said the RSR in a statement. "The Railway Safety Regulator extends its heartfelt condolences to the affected families. The RSR further appeals to the public and all road and rail users to always take safety precautions, follow the road rules and signage, be vigilant at all times when approaching a railway level crossing and always make use of designated level crossings and road-over-rail bridges." “It is very sad and extremely concerning that this level crossing has yet again claimed the lives of road users. We need to re-double our efforts on our collaborations in enforcing the rail-road interface rules to ensure the safety of our people. One life lost is one life too many,” said the RSR Acting CEO, Ms Tshepo Kgare.

In 2010, 10 children were killed in an accident at the same level crossing. eNCA
