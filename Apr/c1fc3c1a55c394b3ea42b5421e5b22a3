JOHANNESBURG - Tired of stressing about ongoing protests, VAT increases and state capture? There might be a place to discuss the same issues in a tongue and cheek manner as South African ventriloquist Conrad Koch and his loud-mouthed puppet Chester Missing open their "Puppet Guy" show at Montecasino in Johannesburg on Wednesday. #PuppetGuy posters going up on street poles around Sandton & Fourways today. Tweet a pic of one on a pole and stand a chance to win 2 tickets for next week Wednesday & Thursday! pic.twitter.com/kKHUypqQZq The show which is in its Johannesburg leg after Cape Town will run from Wednesday until May 27, 2018. Chester Missing is known for his no-nonsense approach to politicians. He throws shade, usually asks awkward questions but gets hugs and kisses in response. eNCA
