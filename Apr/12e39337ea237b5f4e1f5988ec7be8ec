JOHANNESBURG – Cosatu wants a quick resolution to the strike affecting bus services countrywide. It says the working class is suffering the most. “...The strike is designed to teach the bosses a lesson by affecting their level of profits but at the moment the bosses are carrying on. The only people hard done by the strike is the commuters with no alternative transport especially in a big city like Cape Town,” said Cosatu Western Cape secretary, Tony Ehrenreich. Meanwhile, the South Africa Transport and Allied Workers Union (Satawu) said the ongoing nationwide bus strike could have been prevented if the employer was negotiating in good faith. Bus drivers across the country have downed tools, demanding better salaries. They are demanding a 12 percent pay increase but they are being offered seven percent. UPDATE: Long queues at taxi ranks as bus drivers go on strike Satawu spokesperson, Zanele Sabela said: “We were supposed to meet yesterday and discuss and maybe see if we can prevent the strike but they pulled out they say because we gave them the notice to strike. They did not come to the negotiations.” “We ended up meeting as unions to prepare for today. Luckily the CCMA has come in and is willing to intervene for public interest. So tomorrow and on Friday we have the meetings scheduled and we have that that will help to solve the dispute.” eNCA
