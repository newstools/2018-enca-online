CAPE TOWN - Civil society is outraged at the Department of Home Affairs for failing to comply with a Supreme Court of Appeal ruling which ordered that a Cape Town Refugee Reception office is reopened. In 2012, the department opted to close the Cape Town office in an aim to centralise and control the process. The court ordered that the centre reopen by 31 March this year but to date, this has still not happened. NGOs assisting asylum seekers say the closure has had a dire impact on this vulnerable group. There are currently only three offices around the country which can assist -- Durban, Musina and Pretoria. This means travelling long distances for documentation. The Department of Home Affairs claims the delays are due to the Department of Public Works, which is still in the process of securing a premises. But the Department of Public Works says it was only approached with this task in February this year. It says it hopes to finalise the process by July. * Watch the full video report by Aarti Narsee in the gallery above. eNCA
