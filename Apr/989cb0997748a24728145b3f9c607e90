JOHANNESBURG - Cosatu, and a group of public sector unions, are warning government of a total shutdown if it doesn't agree to a new wage deal for public servants. Talks with the state have deadlocked, as workers demand a 12 percent wage hike. READ:Â Strike looming in the public service sector "All the 17 unions have decided that enough is enough. We've had enough of the delaying tactics of the employer," said Mugwena Maluleke, Public Sector Union Representative. About 230,000 public sector workers could go on strike if they do not receive the above-mentioned hikes. eNCA
