CAIRO - Three Chinese tourists were killed on Tuesday and eight others were injured in a road accident in Alexandria, Egypt's second city, a government statement said. Two of those injured were in critical condition, the statement said. Tourism was one of Egypt's main sources of income but fewer visitors have come since a 2011 uprising. A plane crash in 2015 led to a further drop in tourist numbers. In recent months, more have come due in part to renewed political stability. Reuters
