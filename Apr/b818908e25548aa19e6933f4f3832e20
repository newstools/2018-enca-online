JOHANNESBURG – Former president Jacob Zuma may have appeared in the KwaZulu-Natal High Court for only half-an-hour on Friday morning, but his relaxed demeanour in the dock and defiant address outside grabbed the country's attention. Zuma is charged with 16 counts of corruption, money-laundering, fraud and racketeering related to 783 payments he allegedly received in connection with the controversial multi-billion rand arms deal. READ: Zuma tells supporters charges against him are political The case was postponed to June 8 while the defence mounts an application to review the state's decision to prosecute him. His supporters gathered for a night vigil at the Durban's Albert Park on Thursday and then to the court carrying placards with slogans like #HandsOffZuma. Lots of fanfare as pro-Jacob Zuma supporters make their way to court in support of the former president. #ZumaCharges pic.twitter.com/dDy2TkW2Zm For a peek at what Zuma looked like inside and outside court, click on the gallery above. eNCA
