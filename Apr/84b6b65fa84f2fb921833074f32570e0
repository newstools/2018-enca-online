RUSTENBURG - Boxing great Norman "Pangaman" Sekgapane has died, his family said on Wednesday. "He departed this afternoon [Wednesday, April 4] at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, Soweto, after a long illness. Although he was based in Mahikeng, he spent months in and out of the hospital in Johannesburg," his son Thabo Sekgapane said. I remember when I first met Norman "Pangaman" Sekgapane ko Mafikeng, he was so humble. Legend! RIP -- -- "He was a humble man, who was soft-spoken. He was renowned for being quiet off the ring and did not seem bothered as everybody else was preparing for their bouts. He approached his craft with dignity and made his statements with his fists." Plans for memorial and funeral services were not yet finalised. Sekgapane was a great boxer who made a name for himself during the 1970s. He retired in 1981 with a record of 51 wins, 21 of which came inside the distance. He had 15 losses and two draws. African News Agency
