JOHANNESBURG – Social media users have slammed DJ and record producer Nkosinathi Maphumulo, better known as DJ Black Coffee, for performing in Israel. The DJ tweet about a sold-out event in the city of Tel Aviv. People said he had indeed sold out by defying calls for a boycott of Israel because of its treatment of Palestineans and "occupation" of land. Among the critics was Economic Freedom Fighters chief whip Floyd Shivhambu. "That Israel is killing innocent Palestinians & continuing with the occupation doesn’t matter? A DJ from SA, a country that benefited due to international solidarity must just go to Israel for a party & we Black people celebrate such? Where’s the political & moral consciousness?" asked Shivhambu in a tweet. DJ Black Coffee responded to the critics saying that he is not a  political party but a DJ working for the good of his family.
