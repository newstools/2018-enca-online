JOHANNESBURG – Rapper Kanye West expressed his “love” for President Donald Trump on twitter, as a result the Trump campaign is selling signed MAGA (Make America Great Again). In a series of tweets Kanye praised Trump for being a “free thinker” and said that “Group "Group think is a mandate in today's society.” You don't have to agree with trump but the mob can't make me not love him. We are both dragon energy. He is my brother. I love everyone. I don't agree with everything anyone does. That's what makes us individuals. And we have the right to independent thought. Free thinkers don't fear retaliation for your thoughts. The traditional thinkers are only using thoughts and words but they are in a mental prison. You are free. You've already won. Feel energized. Move in love not fear. Be afraid of nothing. "We are both dragon energy. He is my brother. I love everyone. I don't agree with everything anyone does. That's what makes us individuals. And we have the right to independent thought," tweeted Kanye. The Republican National Committee tweeted the 40-year-old rapper’s signed MAGA hat with a link to Trump’s online store.
