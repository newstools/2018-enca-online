Autopax sent an email to staff saying it doesn’t have money to pay them. The company operates City to City and Translux buses. Interim CEO Nathi Khena said the company is working on a recovery plan to deal with its financial crisis. Prasa’s Acting Group CEO Lindikaya Zide has instructed Autopax pay staff salaries on Thursday. Zide said he is appalled at the issuing of this "irresponsible memorandum" to staff. "I want to assure our staff and the South African public that this is not the fabric of Prasa," he said "It is not a reflection of how we view the value of our staff.” eNCA
