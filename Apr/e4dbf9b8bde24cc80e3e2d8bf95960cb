GOODWOOD - Two wardens from Goodwood correctional facility were injured after being stabbed by an inmate while the officers unlocked his cell. READ: 16 prisoners escape from Sun City prison The wardens were reportedly opening the cell to allow the inmates out for their morning meal. The incident is believed to be gang-related. The two officials were taken to the N1 City hospital where they were both treated and then discharged. The officials are now recovering at home. Witnesses to the stabbing said the assailant had been transferred from another prison and was attempting to prove he was a high-ranking member of a gang. A search of the cells at Goodwood by the DCS Emergency Support Team revealed contraband items including a cellphone, sharp shaving blades, and a few self-made knives. The items were confiscated by the officials. UPDATE: Five rearrested, one still at large after Pollsmoor prison break Police have opened a criminal case and are still investigating the incident. The assailant was isolated from the rest of the offender population and is currently incarcerated in a single cell, according to Department of Correctional Services spokesperson, Simphiwe Xako. Violence against correctional officials also broke out at Poolsmoor correctional facility in January when four officials were treated for burns after inmates drenched them in boiling water during a search operation. Western Cape Regional Commissioner Delekile Klaas held a lengthy behind-the-scenes meeting with the Provincial Commissioner of the South African Police Service. This meeting’s focus centred around intensifying proactive and effective mechanisms of detecting any similar future potential incidents, the spiralling gang activities in correctional facilities around the Western Cape, and strengthening other areas of cooperation between the two institutions. Authorities are closely monitoring the situation. eNCA
