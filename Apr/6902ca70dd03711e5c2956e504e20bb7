JOHANNESBURG – AfriForum Advocate, Gerrie Nel says he's not going to respond to Julius Malema's tweet on the decision to privately prosecute him. The EFF leader challenged the lobby group to go ahead with the case. “You must know that we have dealt with the matters where most people say I want my day in court please give me my day in court when that happen there is a lot of representation and attempts to avoid it. I will not get into personal discussion with everybody that I have prosecuted. I only do my job. I am a prosecutor I look at the law. I will not respond to any of those matters even if they are very personal and challenging.” WATCH: AfriForum to privately prosecute Malema AfriForum said on Thursday that they will prosecute Malema for fraud and corruption linked to On-Pointing Engineering contract. In 2015, however, Malema's corruption case was struck off the roll. eNCA
