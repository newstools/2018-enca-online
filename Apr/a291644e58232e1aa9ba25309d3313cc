PARYS - Stompie Seipei’s mother says she made peace with Winnie Madikizela-Mandela a long time ago. Speaking from her home in Parys, Free State, on Sunday afternoon, Joyce Seipei recalled when she met the struggle veteran, who was accused of involvement in Seipei's son's death in the late 1980s. #WinnieMandela Mananki Joyce Seipei says she reconciled with #WinnieMandela in toilet with the death of #StompieSeipei. pic.twitter.com/kzKPuhKJiJ Seipei said: “There was an organisation called Ilitha Labantu and they were talking about when your child has been murdered, would you ever forgive. I asked myself if I would ever be able to forgive or not. But I went out to the toilet and left my younger child. I asked God to help me forgive because this thing will affect me. That’s when I felt free - until I met Winnie. "I met Winnie in the toilet without anybody knowing. My child loved playing with water and always wanted to go to the toilet. When we get there he would wash his hands. That’s when I hear him greeting Winnie and asked her to come and see me. Zindzi and Winnie both held him by his hands and came to me. The first thing she said was I looked like my son Stompie. That’s when I forgave Winnie and I felt free”.
