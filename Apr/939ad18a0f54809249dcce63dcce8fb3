RUSTENBURG - Impala Platinum handed three schools over to the North West department of education in Rustenburg on Friday. "We as Impala take education very seriously. As our social responsibility we always try to ensure that we put the people first because we believe that it is through education that we can beat the poverty," said CEO Mark Munroe. "We believe that the schools will produce future leaders who will also come back and Work for us or even work around the country and bring change." The construction of the two schools, Platinum Village Primary and Platinum Village Secondary, was completed in 2016 to the tune of R130 million. The Sunrise View Secondary School which was completed in 2013 as part of Impalaâ€™s social and labour plan (SLP) projects was also officially handed to the department of education. Platinum Village was filled with excitement, parents, learners and educators filled the event to witness the successful opening of the two schools. Basic Education Deputy Minister Enver Surty said it was important that the schools were well taken care of. He also encouraged learners to work very hard as they now have the opportunity to access education. North West Premier, Supra Mahumapelo said the provincial government appreciate the work done by Impala to better the lives of the people as it was the responsibility of mines to make sure that they were also part of the development of the environment they operate in. "We as the government cannot do it alone. We also plead with others mines to do the same to empower and let our people benefit from the mines," he said African News Agency
