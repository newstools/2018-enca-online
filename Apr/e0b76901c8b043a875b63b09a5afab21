DURBAN – Orlando Pirates kept their slim league title chances alive by scoring a late goal to beat Amazulu 2-1 in an Absa Premiership match played at the King Zwelithini Stadium in Durban on Sunday afternoon. Starting the match with six points behind log-leaders Mamelodi Sundowns, the visitors' chances of a late title surge took a knock when midfielder Ovidy Karuru charged down the right-hand side of the park in the 10th minute, before providing a square pass for veteran Mabhuti Khanyeza to finish off. Thank you #Buccaneers

Amazulu tried their best to get in front again, but it was the visitors who got the deciding goal in the 80th minute when a cross from the left just evaded Zambian striker Justin Shonga, but Thabo Qalinge was hand to fire home from close range. Pirates move to 49 points from 27 games and will be hoping to keep the pressure on Sundowns in the run-in to the end of the league season. The Buccaneers, as Pirates are known, will host Bidvest Wits in their next match on April 25. Amazulu, in 10th spot on the league table with 32 points from 27 matches, will travel to Rustenburg to play bottom-of-the-log Platinum Stars on the same date. African News Agency
