JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) has distanced itself from its members who went to court to support former president Jacob Zuma on Friday. Party spokesperson Pule Mabe says those members acted in their personal capacity. "We will not in any way take away the right of individual members and their own preferences and all of that, including declaring guilty verdicts of those who are expected to appear in court,, and I think Zuma is also protected by the laws of the republic," said Mabe. #ZumaCharges ANC Reaction on today’s court appearance by their former President and party members wearing party colours to support him. pic.twitter.com/h9tV2KRrsm The ANC had resolved that no ANC member should support Zuma in party capacity or while wearing ANC regalia. However, supporters of the former president wore ANC colours while hosting a night vigil for him on the eve of his court appearance on charges of fraud, corruption, money-laundering, and racketeering.
