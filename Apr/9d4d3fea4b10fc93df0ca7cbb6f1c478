JOHANNESBURG - The South African government have strongly objected to a travel advisory that has been issued by Australia. Australia urged its residents to exercise a high degree of caution when visiting South Africa because of high levels of crime. It cited a long list of crimes including rape, murder and spiked drinks. Government said the advisory is misleading and has the potential to tarnish South Africa's image. In February, Australia's Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton accused South Africa of persecuting white farmers. He said they need protection from a civilised country like Australia. eNCA
