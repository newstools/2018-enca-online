JOHANNESBURG - SACP General Secretary Blade Nzimande says Janusz Walus must rot in jail for killing Chris Hani. He was speaking at the 25th anniversary of Hani’s assassination at Ekhurhuleni earlier on Tuesday. UPDATE: No parole for Hani killer Waluś "Janus Walus the convicted murderer who pull the trigger on comrade Chris is still in prison and we want to say as the SACP he must stay in jail not because we are evil people. As the SACP just like the Hani family all we want is the truth," said Nzimande. "There are too many things that never came together in their story to the TRC that is why the TRC did not grant them amnesty. We still want the whole truth and we will never rest until we get the whole truth," He said. The late SACP leader, Chris Hani, was assassinated on this day 25 years ago. eNCA
