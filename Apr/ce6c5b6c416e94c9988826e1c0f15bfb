CAPE TOWN - The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF)'s new regulations are unjust, sexist and designed to eliminate Caster Semenya's career, Parliamentary Speaker Baleka Mbete and chairperson of the National Council of Provinces Thandi Modise said on Sunday. The IAAF ordered athletes like Semenya to use medication to lower unusually high levels of testosterone as they are perceived to have an unfair advantage in running events.

They accused the IAAF of making a mockery of the physiques of African women. READ: Sports minister calls on South Africans to rally behind Semenya "Such an act should be rejected with the contempt it deserves as it threatens, not just Caster’s career, but the sacrosanct principles of fairness, justice and equality in global sports. The act also threatens the entire generation of young girls from rural and disadvantaged backgrounds who are inspired by her to break the proverbial glass ceilings in their careers of choice," the presiding officers said. "The IAAF's conduct is a danger to the future of next generations of particularly African sportswomen, who will be confronted with similar apartheid-type targeted regulations if their talent and hard work become a threat to their counterparts from the rest of the world." Parliament also committed to working with government in an effort to support Semenya in her battle against the new regulations. eNCA
