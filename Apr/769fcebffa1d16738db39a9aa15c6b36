JOHANNESBURG – Police have confirmed they are investigating assassination threats against EFF leader, Julius Malema. The party believes a small group in the North West is planning to kill him. EFF acting spokesperson, Tebogo Mokwele said: “The actions since 2016 going to the local government elections. The Twitter account of the CIC (commander-in-chief)... (was) hacked. For security reasons, we can’t disclose now, but we are definitely making sure that our CIC is safe. And we are making sure that not only the CIC but the entire leadership is safe through our security department.” READ: EFF claims there's a plot to assassinate Malema The alleged plot is said to be connected with EFF sponsored plans to remove North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo via a vote of no confidence. The party has alerted the police minister - and the national police commissioner Kehla Sithole, who confirmed that the matter is being urgently attended to. “We're treating this in a very serious light. Hence, our assessments need to be done quite speedily so we are not faced with a situation where there is an attempt on his life while the assessment is being conducted. As a rule, we don't discuss this in a public domain. So I am trying to avoid going into all the details. But trust me: things are being done as we speak,” said police spokesperson, Vish Naidoo. The no-confidence vote that had been planned for Tuesday was postponed, while the EFF awaits a decision from the North West Speaker over the party's request for the vote to be conducted via secret ballot. eNCA
