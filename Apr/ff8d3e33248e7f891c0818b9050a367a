JOHANNESBURG - Winnie Madikizela-Mandela was the target of the apartheid regime's most concentrated propaganda campaign. A former security operative of Stratcom said there were spies planted in the Mandela Football Club. Paul Erasmus has now also claimed -- for the first time -- that the entire club was made up of spies. The 62-year-old revealed some of the tactics the Stratcom unit used to try and destroy Madikizela-Mandela’s reputation.
