MUNICH - Veteran duo Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery started for Bayern Munich in Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final second leg at home to Sevilla. Both Robben, 34, and Ribery, 35, are out of contract at the end of the season, but Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has implied the pair will be offered extensions. Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes opted for pace on the wings as Thiago Alcantara, who scored the winning header in the 2-1 first-leg victory in Spain last week, started on the bench. With one eye on a potential semi-final, Ribery, Robert Lewandowski, Jerome Boateng and Joshua Kimmich must tread carefully as they are a booking away from a ban. Sevilla need to score at least twice at the Allianz Arena to keep their semi-final dreams alive, putting pressure on France international Wissem Ben Yedder to grab the goals. Playmaker Ever Banega returns from suspension to partner Steven N'Zonzi in central midfield. With Simon Kjaer out injured, Gabi Mercado plays at centre-back, having missed the first leg with an injury.
