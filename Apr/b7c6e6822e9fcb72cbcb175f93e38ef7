BRUSSELS - As many as 2.7 million people in the European Union may have been affected by the Facebook personal data scandal, the bloc announced on  Friday, saying it would demand further answers from the social media giant. "Facebook confirmed to us that the data of overall up to 2.7 million people in the EU may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica," spokesman Christian Wigand told reporters. On Wednesday, Facebook said the personal data of as many as 87 million users around the world was improperly shared with British political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.
