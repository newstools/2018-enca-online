LIVERPOOL - Liverpool central defender Joel Matip will probably miss the rest of the season due to a thigh injury, the Premier League club said on Tuesday. The Cameroon international sustained the problem in Saturday's 2-1 Premier League victory over Crystal Palace and will definitely miss the Champions League quarter-final against Manchester City.
