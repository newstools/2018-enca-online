JOHANNESBURG – Political analyst Ralph Mathekga says the ANC will have a tough time getting rid of North West Premier, Supra Mahumapelo. He says the premier will not give up without a fight as he risks facing corruption charges.

He needs that position so that he fights back. The ANC needs to make sure that if they get rid of leadership they do in such a way that he doesn’t go to KZN to work with other factions.” READ: Mahumapelo welcomes raid on his offices He added that ANC's top 6 appears to be divided over the future of Mahumapelo. “I am not convinced that the Top 6 has a clear position on this. I think they are quite divided and when you’re confronted with a situation like this you manage it, you take your position and you try to convince your fellow comrades that this is what we can do and it's in our best interest to stabilise North West before they go into elections next year.” Last week, protests flared up in Mahikeng, with residents calling for Mahumapelo's resignation. The ANC's National Working Committee is expected to deliberate on Mahumapelo's future. eNCA
