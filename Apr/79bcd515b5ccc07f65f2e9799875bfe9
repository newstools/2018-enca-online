PARIS - Rafael Nadal reclaimed top spot in the men's ATP rankings on Monday a day after Swiss rival Roger Federer crashed out in Miami to American John Isner. Nadal, who hasn't hit a ball in anger since pulling out of the Australian Open quarter-finals in January, saw Federer take over top spot on February 18. The Swiss veteran, however, slipped 10 points behind his Spanish rival and into second place after a second-round defeat to Isner that saw the towering American leap eight places to ninth thanks to his eventual victory Sunday in the Masters 1000 event.
