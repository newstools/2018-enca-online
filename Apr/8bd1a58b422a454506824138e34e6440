DURBAN - Free State Stars advanced to their first cup final since 1999, when they beat Kaizer Chiefs 2-0 in their Nedbank Cup semi-final match played at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban on Saturday evening. It took Stars just 45 seconds to unlock the Chiefs defence, with Congolese striker Harris Tchilimbou finding the back of the net with a well-timed header, with the cross coming from Nyiko Mobbie after some superb build-up play by the Bethlehem-based side. Stars' goalkeeper Thela Ngobeni kept his side in the lead a few minutes later by spreading his body to block a shot on goal from Chiefs midfielder Joseph Molangoane. In the 34th minute, Stars doubled their lead through Tchilimbou, who chested the ball down to score past goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune, after a quality cross from the left side of midfield. The best of the chances for Chiefs fell to Ryan Moon, but it was not to be Chiefsâ€™ night, with not even the introduction of goal-hungry Leonardo Castro at the start of the second half (in place of full-back Tshepo Masilela), able to change the outcome. Stars, on 39 points from 27 league games, have had a dream season after finishing in third last position in the 2016/2017 campaign. They will take on relegation-threatened SuperSport United in a league match in Pretoria on Wednesday. Chiefs in fourth place in the league on 42 points from 27 matches, will take on Golden Arrows in Durban on Tuesday in their next league fixture. African News Agency
