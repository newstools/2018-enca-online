JOHANNESBURG – A letter has been written to National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete asking whether arrests should be effected against Dudu Myeni, Duduzane Zuma and the Gupta brothers for ignoring a summons. This was revealed to eNCA by Eskom Inquiry chairperson Zukiswa Rantho outside Parliament in Cape Town on Tuesday afternoon. She further revealed that the committee was now drafting its final report on mismanagement at the cash-strapped parastatal. The decision to write to Mbete was made during a private sitting of the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises. Rantho said the meeting was not heated and the issue was now squarely in the hands of the speaker. “The committee has done its best,” she added. Anyone who ignores a summons risks facing arrest. eNCA
