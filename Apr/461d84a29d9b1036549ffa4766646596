JOHANNESBURG - International Relations and Cooperation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu travelled to Lesotho on Friday to apologise to King Letsie III after he was recently “mistreated” at the border by South African officials. Sisulu's spokesperson, Ndivhuwo Mubaya, confirmed that Sisulu made the damage-control trip to the kingdom specifically to apologise to the king. On Tuesday senior government officials intervened to quell the diplomatic spat after the king said he was aggrieved by the way he had been treated. The high-level government intervention involved Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba travelling to the border following reports that aggrieved Basotho were planning to block the busy border post.
