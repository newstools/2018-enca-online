MONTE CARLO – Novak Djokovic was knocked out of the Monte Carlo Masters by an inspired Dominic Thiem in the third round while world number one Rafael Nadal cruised to a 6-3, 6-2 victory over Russian Karen Khachanov on Thursday. Thiem, a two-time French Open semi-finalist, was the better player for much of the match and won 6-7 (2/7), 6-2, 6-3 despite a battling effort from Djokovic. The 12-time Grand Slam champion has still not reached a quarter-final since Wimbledon last July after struggling with a right elbow injury.
