EASTERN CAPE - After years of promises, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela’s Brandfort house is still not a museum. Now, her family in Mbizana is pleading with President Cyril Ramaphosa to ensure that the project planned for her Mbizana home succeeds. WATCH: Memorial service in Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's home village “It was a long time ago Mr President. It was during Paul Mashatile’s tenure as Minister. Previously we engaged with the National Heritage Council and they listened to my aunt. Advocate Sonwabile Mancotywa and his team came to assess the area. They promised to follow up and make a decision," said Thembelani Madikizela, family member. "We’re anxious now Mr President as my aunt is no more. We're anxious about whether the project will continue. There are defined programs that we happen to be aware of as the family," he said. He was speaking at a memorial service to honour Madikizela-Mandela in Mbizana. Madikizela-Mandela will be laid to rest on 14 April. eNCA
