JOHANNESBURG – The Democratic Alliance says it will not punish Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille for addressing mourners at an Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) service for the late Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. DA spokesperson Refiloe Nt'sekhe says in a statement that reports that the party will charge De Lille over her attendance are "simply untrue". "Ms De Lille’s attendance at the memorial yesterday (Wednesday)  is a matter between her and the EFF leadership and not the DA. A courtesy call to alert the DA about her attendance would have been welcomed," Nt'sekhe said. De Lille and the DA are at loggerheads, with the party laying bribery and corruption charges against her earlier this month. The charges are related to an alleged attempt by De Lille to solicit a R5-million bribe from Vanderbijlpark businessman Anthony Foul in 2012. Nt'sekhe says the DA did seek an explanation as to why De Lille did not inform the party prior to the EFF memorial. “Nobody says there is a problem with the mayor speaking at the event. What we are saying is, the party would have appreciated a courtesy call just for us to know that she is also being invited as a guest speaker.” READ: Is the EFF wooing Patricia de Lille? Ntsekhe said DA leader Mmusi Maimane was also invited to attend the EFF's memorial, but was unable to attend. He would pay his respects at the official funeral on Saturday. eNCA
