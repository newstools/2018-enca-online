JOHANNESBURG - The #JuliusMalemaChallenge was abuzz on Saturday afternoon following the Economic Freedom Fighters' (EFF) speech at Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's funeral at Orlando stadium in Soweto. During his speech, Malema said those who betrayed Madikizela-Mandela while she was still alive were at her funeral. He then asked for her to send a signal on what should be done to deal with the critics now that she's gone.
