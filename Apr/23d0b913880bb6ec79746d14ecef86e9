JOHANNESBURG - The #JuliusMalemaChallenge was abuzz on Saturday afternoon following the Economic Freedom Fighters' (EFF) speech at Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's funeral at Orlando stadium in Soweto. During his speech, Malema said those who betrayed Madikizela-Mandela while she was still alive were at her funeral. He then asked for her to send a signal on what should be done to deal with the critics now that she's gone. Twitter users joined in the chorus and called for a signal on how to deal with people who are behind high data prices, VAT and bogus churches. The DA Mpumalanga leader Jane Sithole joined in and called out those she believed increased VAT. It rained after Madikizela-Mandela's funeral and EFF chairperson Dali Mpofu believed that was a sign that the party would do well in next year's general elections. He said "re tlo tshela thupa" (we will show them). Zimbabweans quickly caught up on the hashtag. It went south after that with some calling out their partners, car guards and shop-owners. eNCA
