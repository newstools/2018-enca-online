Janieve Russell (Jamaica) won in a time of 54.33 seconds with Eilidh Doyle (Scotland) second in 54.80. It was the third time the Scot finished second in the 400m-hurdles at the Commonwealth Games. Nel clocked a time of 54.96. Nel admitted that she had her work cut out to secure a medal place finish. “Going over the last hurdle it felt for the moment as if I was going to crash down. Luckily I managed to recover. Over the last 50 metres, it was a case of running as never before. I was not immediately sure if I had done enough to medal. The moment I realised I had done enough to be on the podium is one that I will cherish for a long time to come." Nel went out hard and was leading in the early stages of the race. Smashing run by Wenda Nel in the 400m hurdles final. She earns the bronze medal, crossing the line in 54.96. She's a grinder. Puts in the hard yards year in and year out. Very well deserved #GC2018 #TeamMzansi “The plan was to go out hard as I wanted to push my body to see what I am capable of. At the end of the day, it was perhaps not my most perfect race, but I guess it does not matter, I had achieved what I set out to do.” African News Agency
