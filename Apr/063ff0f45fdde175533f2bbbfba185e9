JOHANNESBURG - Steve Komphela is feeling the heat after his Kaizer Chiefs side went down 3-0 to Chippa United. Poor defending allowed former Pirates player Thabo Rakhale to give Chippa the lead. The Chilliboys added two second-half goals to rub more salt into the wounds of the Amakhosi faithful. Ugly scenes followed the blowing of the final whistle, with fans launching missiles at both players and staff. Chiefs supporters also had their say on Twitter. eNCA
