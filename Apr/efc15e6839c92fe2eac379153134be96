JOHANNESBURG - Following a two-day workshop on public-private partnership versus public sector solutions, organised by Nigeria’s Public Services International in the capital Lagos, civil society and labour groups have reacted negatively saying privatising key public sectors violates the Nigerian constitution.

However, Biobelemoye questioned how the new policies had impacted on the salary of the average Nigerian and how it had helped those on the minimum wage. “Has the cost of treating malaria reduced with the emergence of PPPs in some hospitals? How much is the cost of card collection at Garki Hospital Abuja and the Federal Medical Centre Jabi etc?” he asked. “It is absolutely unfortunate that policies are driven to suit the interest of few Nigerians at the expense of the poor, disadvantaged and vulnerable citizens,” stated Biobelemoye.

Instead of focusing on corruption and issues that would serve the health sector better the government had diagnosed paucity of funds, leading to inadequate funding as the major set-back while presenting PPP as the answer.
