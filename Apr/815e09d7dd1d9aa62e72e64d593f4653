JOHANNESBURG - The National Prosecuting Authority has now decided to press ahead with culpable homicide charges against former president Jacob Zuma's son. The state says Duduzane Zuma missed his two-month deadline to make representations in the case. Three years ago, Zuma crashed his Porsche into the back of a minibus taxi, killing Phumzile Dube, a mother of one.

In October 2017, AfriForum announced it would pursue a private prosecution of Zuma. It is unclear whether that prosecution will now fall away. Dube's daughter, who was three-years-old at the time of her mother’s death, now lives in Zimbabwe with her grandmother. Zuma is also facing arrest for repeatedly snubbing summonses to appear before Parliament's inquiry into state capture. His whereabouts are unclear with his legal representatives previously saying he is out of the country. eNCA
