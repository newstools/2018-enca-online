JOHANNESBURG - Former First Lady Graca Machel says it would’ve been wonderful for Mama Winnie to hear words of tribute about her while she was still alive. Machel paid a moving tribute to the struggle veteran at Constitution Hill earlier on Monday. WATCH: Seipei's mother says she forgave Winnie long ago “As a person, I take long to process pain. I prefer to be quite, to feel it and understand the significant of the pain I’m going through. Let me say something, as a nation we tend to wake up to realise who are the people who have made us as a nation, people who sacrifice, we tend to wake up and recognise them when they leave," she said. Machel essentially says we must recognize our heroes while they are still alive. #WinnieMandela pic.twitter.com/I6okan91ht "Can you imagine how wonderful it would have been for mama to sit among us and listen to those tribute which have been pouring. Don’t you think it would have been fair for her to sit and listen simple to her children…don’t you think it would have been wonderful, really great for her to have all the untruths which were allowed to live with us to be cleared while she’s still among us. For her to hear from all races, all people just to say how unique she is in our history and how unique she continue to be,” said Machel. Memorial services are being held all over the country in honour of Madikizela-Mandela. She will be laid to rest this weekend on 14 April. eNCA
