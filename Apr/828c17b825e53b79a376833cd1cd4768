JOHANNESBURG – The Council for the Advancement of the SA Constitution (Casac) wants the Public Protector to explain why she made changes to her report into the R2-million Estina Dairy Farm tender. The organisation says Busisiwe Mkhwebane deliberately watered down her report on the Vrede dairy farm scandal to protect ANC secretary-general, Ace Magashule and former minister Mosebenzi Zwane. READ: Zwane, Magashule distance themselves from Estina scandal “That is a question that advocate Mkhwebane would need to answer, is to provide reasons as to why she changed those reports it does seem as an attempt to protect certain individuals…late in the day after she had deliberately removed those recommendations really calls to question her independence, her commitment to act without fear or favour,” said Casac's executive secretary Lawson Naidoo. Casac said the Public Protector is not capable of conducting the investigation. “We’re part of an agenda to ensure that constitutional institutions perform their functions, as the Constitutions requires them to do so… We say she is incapable of conducting this investigation… We want the investigation to be declared unconstitutional and to ask her not to continue to investigate because she has proven to be incapable in this matter.” The Public Protector's office said it would give a comprehensive response to Casac's accusations on Monday. eNCA
