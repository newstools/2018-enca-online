HARARE - Zimbabwean police investigating an ivory-smuggling racket will soon question former first lady Grace Mugabe, who is accused of arranging shipments abroad, a government-owned newspaper reported on Friday. The Herald newspaper, once the mouthpiece of the Mugabe regime, said police were making progress in their probe into Grace's alleged role in smuggling to China, the United Arab Emirates and the United States. "We are closing in with our investigations," a police source told the paper.

Once outside Zimbabwe, the ivory was allegedly routed to black markets. A police spokesman declined to comment to AFP on Friday. Grace Mugabe had been tipped as a candidate to succeed her husband before he was forced to step down in November. She has not been seen in public since, but attended a media meeting her husband held at their house in the capital last month. Mugabe is known for her lavish spending and fierce verbal attacks on her husband's perceived critics. AFP
