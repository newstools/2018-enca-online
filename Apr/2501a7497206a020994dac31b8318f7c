JOHANNESBURG - The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday lifted South Africa’s economic growth forecast for the next two years citing the election of a new political leadership, but warned growth would underperform if no economic reforms were carried out. The economy has received a shot in the arm with the appointment of President Cyril Ramaphosa in February replacing scandal-prone Jacob Zuma. Ramaphosa has promised to revive the economy and crack down on government corruption. The IMF raised its 2018 forecast of gross domestic product to 1.5 percent for 2018 and 1.7 for 2019, compared to previous forecasts of 0.9 percent and 1.6 percent respectively.

However, advancement of the outstanding reforms is critical for reinvigorating economic growth and making it more inclusive,” said the IMF. The IMF said the reforms would improve infrastructure in transport and telecommunication sectors to spur growth.

Growth in sub-Saharan Africa is projected to rise to 3.4 percent in 2018 and 3.7 percent in 2019, the IMF said. eNCA
