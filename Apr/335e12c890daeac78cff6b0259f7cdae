NEW YORK - The global music industry soared a record 8.1 percent last year as digital sales for the first time made up the majority of revenue, thanks to the streaming boom, the industry said on Tuesday. Recorded music grossed $17.3-billion (R2210-billion) in 2017 with digital music - until last year roughly equal to physical sales worldwide - amounting to 54 percent of the revenue, the IFPI global body said in its annual report.

But the industry still is only about two-thirds of the value it was in the 1990s before the rise of the internet and the scourge of pirated music sent the music business into a 15-year slump, Moore said. The resurgence is almost entirely due to the rapid growth of streaming services including Spotify, Deezer and Apple Music, which have given the industry a badly needed new source of revenue.

Physical sales tumbled again but one bright side was vinyl, which remains a sliver of the market but grew 22.3 percent as records find a renewed market among audiophiles. AFP
