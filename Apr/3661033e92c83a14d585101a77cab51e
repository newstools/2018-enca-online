JOHANNESBURG – Former Chief Whip of the Democratic Alliance (DA) Douglas Gibson has described former safety and security minister Sydney Mufamadi’s accounts that Tony Leon asked for the reopening of Stompie case as a "ridiculous lie". On Monday morning, Mufamadi shed light on his alleged involvement tarnishing Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's image. This after damning claims by former police head of the murder and robbery squad Henk Heslinger in the documentary about Winnie Mandela’s life. Heslinger, in the documentary Winnie, claims he was taken to meet Mufamadi in 1994. He says Mufamadi wanted him to restart investigations into Madikizela-Mandela in an effort to have her tried for murder.

Gibson, on behalf of Leon who is grieving his father’s death, said suggestions of Leon’s involvement in the matter is a ridiculous lie. “Any suggestion of an involvement with Stratcom before 1994 when he was the opposition justice spokesperson, or afterwards, when he was the leader of the opposition to the ANC government is a ridiculous lie,” Gibson said in a statement. “Tony Leon was doing his job and any allegation that he was “behind” the persecution of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela is also a lie."
