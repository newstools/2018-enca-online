DONETSK, Ukraine - Vodafone mobile service has been partially restored in war-torn east Ukraine after a fibre optic line cut in January left up to two million people without cell phone coverage, rebel authorities said Saturday. "Yesterday the Vodafone operator resumed its work in the Donetsk People's Republic," a spokeswoman for the rebel region's communications ministry told AFP.

Cell coverage was already available in the regional capital Donetsk but there was no service on the outskirts of the city and a number of other places.

While mobile phone access was quickly restored in the fellow rebel stronghold of Lugansk, Donetsk residents had remained without proper cellular coverage. Phoenix, a local mobile phone provider launched by the Moscow-backed authorities in 2016, has reaped the benefits of the communications blackout. AFP
