PRETORIA - A family whose boundary wall collapsed due to the sinkhole on the R55 in Laudium says their lives are at risk. Cracks are inching closer to their home and they now fear for their safety. The Esmail family is also unhappy with a lack of communication from the municipality. On 6 April, the family received a letter from the council instructing them to move out or supply a note from engineers stating the home is safe for occupation. Esmail says her family is not responsible for the sinkhole and cannot be expected to carry costs linked to it. WATCH: Motorists urged to avoid R55 due to huge sinkhole The municipality's Dougie Donald says the local government will not pay for engineers to assess the property as it is the responsibility of those residing there. The more than 30-metre deep sinkhole, which developed after heavy rainfall in March, is being monitored on a 24-hour basis. Twenty-five percent of Gauteng sits on dolomitic land, with Centurion and parts of Laudium being Tshwane’s most affected areas.
