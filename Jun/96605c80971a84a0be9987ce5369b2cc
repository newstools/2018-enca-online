TOKYO - It's the hands-free experience you never knew you needed -- a Japanese company has developed a drone-powered umbrella it says can hover over users, protecting them from the sun. The drone-powered sunshade -- being developed by Asahi Power Service -- should be released next year, and will initially target those in need of a hands-free head covering wider than your average hat, like golfers.

"I decided to develop it as I don't like to hold an umbrella," company president Kenji Suzuki told AFP. At 150 centimetres wide, the parasol prototype weighs five kilos and so far can fly for only five minutes on one charge. Asahi Power Service was hoping to quickly extend flying time to at least 20 minutes, partly by making the device lighter, Suzuki said.

"We are now testing the third-generation prototype and trying to overcome (the technological challenges of) hovering in a stable manner above the head of the user and then chasing the user." The drones are fitted with cameras that help the parasols track their owners and stay over the correct head. The company expects the device to have a price tag of about 30,000 yen (about R3,500), a hefty investment for an umbrella that isn't yet able to protect its users from the rain. For now, the devices are not waterproof. "Eventually, we aim to develop it into an umbrella," Suzuki said. AFP
