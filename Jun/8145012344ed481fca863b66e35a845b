The Berta and Gumuz ethnic groups are considered indigenous to Benishangul-Gumuz, which borders Sudan, but the province has a large presence of ethnic Amharas and Oromos, who are labelled "highlanders" and originally hailed from the country's larger Amhara and Oromiya provinces. Ashadli Hassen, the region's president, said nine people have died in the violence so far. A day earlier, officials had said only one person was killed.
