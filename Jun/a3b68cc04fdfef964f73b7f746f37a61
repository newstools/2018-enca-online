JOHANNESBURG – Western Cape locals can breathe a small sigh of relief on Monday after dam levels jumped 6,5 percentage points compared to the same time last year. “The average level for dams across the Western Cape for the week starting 11 June was 25.9%,” a statement said. This was higher than the 23,8 percent recorded last week and the 19.4 percent at the same time in 2017. The latest figures were released by Western Cape Local Government and Environmental Affairs MEC Anton Bredell on Monday. He said while dam levels were up, the drought in the province is still far from over. “Most major dams in the Western Cape are showing slight increases,” Bredell said.

The latest predictions indicate we are in for some cold and wet weather over the next ten days. From Thursday an intense cold front is expected in the Western Cape for what seems to be about a week.” eNCA
