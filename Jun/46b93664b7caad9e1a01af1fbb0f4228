JOHANNESBURG - The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM)’s Congress was off to a shaky start in Boksburg on Gauteng’s East Rand. There were disputes over credentials among members. #NUMCongress2018 The credentials report is being presented. There are 641 delegates and 18 national officials present. There seems to be some objection by delegates from the North West. pic.twitter.com/XhdWBFcbXc [HAPPENING NOW] The #NUMCongress is adjourned for “10 minutes” in order to “consult” with former leaders of the union and #Cosatu office bearers to resolve the impasse. At the heart of the dispute is the dissolution of the Rustenburg regional leadership which some want reversed. pic.twitter.com/xqAf1LbwH6 [JUST IN] After numerous delays, the #Cosatu leadership has successfully intervened, helping the #NUMCongress to finally adopt its credentials.

The status of these members, and if they can attend and vote at the conference, is being debated. The conference cannot continue if the impasse is not resolved.
