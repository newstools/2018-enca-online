JOHANNESBURG – Roofs have been blown off RDP houses and trees have been uprooted in drought-stricken Cape Town. Long-awaited winter rains brought relief, but destruction too. Roofs were also blown off informal structures after strong winds and heavy downpours this week. "We love the rain, we're desperate for rain. The rain we're having is gradually breaking the back of the drought that has crippled the city. Unfortunately, the rain has been accompanied by very strong winds, which have blown roofs off RDP houses," the City of Cape Town’s JP Smith said.

In other cases, there are more significant problems. So we have not had to activate any emergency shelter." WATCH: Cape Town's emergency services prepare for inclement weather About 2,000 structures in areas like Khayelitsha, Langa and Gugulethu, were affected. "The water gushes into our homes, right where we live. We have a problem when it's like this, our kids get sick and our lives are difficult," a resident told eNCA. Disaster management teams will be working overtime and others are on standby, as rains continue in coming days. eNCA
