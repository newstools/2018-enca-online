JOHANNESBURG - Mayor Herman Mashaba on Monday said that the City of Johannesburg would attach property at the headquarters of the African National Congress (ANC) due to its failure to pay over R300,000 in legal fees. This after the council obtained a writ of execution against the party.

The matter arose in September 2017 after the South Gauteng High Court struck from the roll the ANC's urgent application to table a motion of no confidence against the Joburg Speaker Vasco da Gama and Mashaba by secret ballot.

Mashaba said the R300,000 due from the costs awarded by the court belonged to the residents of this city, adding that he will not hesitate to execute this court order should the ANC fail to make payment.
