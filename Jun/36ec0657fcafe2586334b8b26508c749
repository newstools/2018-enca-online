LONDON – England stormed to a world record 481 for six as they demolished Australia's bowling attack in the third match of their ODI series at Trent Bridge, Nottingham on Tuesday. Jonny Bairstow's swashbuckling 139 and a magnificent 147 by Alex Hales took England past the total of 444 for three they made against Pakistan, also at Trent Bridge, two years ago. The biggest 6️⃣ of the day from @AlexHales1 to reach 5️⃣0️⃣! --

England failed to score any boundaries in the last four overs – but before that, they struck 21 sixes during an incredible display of strokeplay. Australia fast bowler Andrew Tye suffered the worst punishment, his nine overs going for 100 runs. Reuters
