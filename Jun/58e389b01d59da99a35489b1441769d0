JOHANNESBURG – Billionaire Christo Wiese is reducing his stake in supermarket giant Shoprite. Shares representing at least 2.9 percent of the chain will be issued to institutional investors on behalf of one of Wiese’s investment companies. READ: Steinhoff wants Christo Wiese to pay back money paid to him The businessman has been offloading assets in lieu of cash following the collapse of Steinhoff, of which he was also a major shareholder. About 97 percent of Steinhoff’s value has been wiped out since accounting irregularities emerged in December. Wiese has sold approximately R4.2-billion worth of Shoprite shares in a number of deals since then. He’s also suing embattled Steinhoff for R59-billion. eNCA
