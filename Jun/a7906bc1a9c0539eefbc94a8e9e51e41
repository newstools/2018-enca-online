TOKYO - The Tokyo DisneySea theme park is getting a $2.3 billion overhaul and adding a section based on the wildly popular movie "Frozen" to its offerings, its operator said Thursday. Oriental Land, which runs the ocean-themed park as well as the adjacent Tokyo Disneyland and hotels, said the 250-billion-yen ($2.3-billion) undertaking will be the most expensive expansion plan in the site's 35-year history. The project will add attractions replicating the Kingdom of Arendelle from "Frozen", a tower inhabited by Rapunzel in the movie "Tangled", and a Neverland for Peter Pan and his friends, along with a new 475-room hotel. Tokyo Disneyland, which has attracted huge crowds since it opened in 1983, is already going through a major upgrade to add new attractions. More than 30 million people visit the combined Disney Resort every year, with numbers expected to increase as Japan works to boost tourism with a goal of 40 million foreign visitors by 2020 when it hosts the Olympic Games.
