JOHANNESBURG â€“ Social Security Agency (Sassa) employees have vowed to go ahead with a strike on Monday. That comes after members of Cosatu and its affiliates called off a planned strike by public servants. EXPLAINER: PSA strike would affect grants, courts and borders A majority of trade unions representing around 100,000 workers agreed to government's offer of a seven percent wage increase. The Public Servants Association (PSA), which was demanding a 12 percent increase, had planned a so-called day of rage on Monday aimed at crippling government services. The Association said the strike by Sassa employees will not disrupt grant payouts but may affect new registrations. eNCA
