NIAMEY - Three suicide bombers killed 10 people at a mosque in Niger's southeastern city of Diffa who had gathered after breaking the Ramadaan fast, an army spokesman said on Tuesday. The area around Diffa, close to Lake Chad and the borders with Nigeria, Chad and Cameroon, is a stronghold for two factions of militant group Boko Haram, which have been fighting to establish an Islamic state in the region.

He later said the three bombers were female. Southeast Niger has seen sporadic attacks by militants loosely linked to Boko Haram. The Islamist group has gradually split into two factions, one of which has pledged allegiance to Syria-based Islamic State. Troops from Niger and the United States killed 11 Islamist militants from that Islamic State affiliate in a firefight last December.

More than 15,000 people have been killed and millions displaced by the conflict in the Lake Chad region. After a deadly assault on the Nigerian town of Bosso in June 2016 killed 32 soldiers, Chad sent 2,000 troops to help Niger, but they were withdrawn in October last year. Reuters
