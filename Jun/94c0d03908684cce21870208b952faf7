BLOEMFONTEIN – England coach Eddie Jones believes there is room for Springbok optimism after his side’s defeat in Bloemfontein on Saturday. The battle of Bloemfontein started in a similar all-action fashion to last week’s thriller before turning into a gritty arm-wrestle for advantage at scrum and ruck time. Also repeating last week’s trend was the Springboks showing their character by coming from two tries down to lead at the break. That swing in momentum set the platform for a dominant display for large parts of the second half as Jones’ side were blanked. “There’s a chance that this side will develop into a very good team in future,” said Jones in his analysis of his opposition. The former Japan mentor took notice of his counterpart’s injection of the "old school" style of play. “It’s been a very traditional Bok rugby performance over the past two Tests. They are doing those traditional things very well.” READ: Kolisi fever running high in PE Rassie Erasmus’ gain is, however, England’s pain as they move their winless run to five matches after initial success under Jones. The Australian-born coach is now fighting for his job despite back-to-back Six Nations titles in 2016 and 2017. First priority heading to Newlands will be to counter the current trend of surrendering big, early leads. “We’re trying to work on a solution, but it just seems like small things keep happening in these games and the players aren’t reacting to them.” Jones insists that there is enough to play for in Cape Town, calling on his side to show their spirit and finish the series on a high. “We’ve got to stick together now. There’s a lot we can get out of that game. We have to get our pride back.” African News Agency
