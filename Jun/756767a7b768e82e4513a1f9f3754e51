NELSPRUIT – Another school has been torched in Mpumalanga after Letfukuthula Primary in Matsulu was set on fire. This according to the Department of Basic Education brings the number of schools that have been burnt in Mpumalanga to three in the past three days. @DBE_SA ANOTHER SCHOOL ON FIRE THIS MORNING!! This is Letfukuthula Primary in Matsulu, Mpumalanga right now. @SABCTVNews @eNCA @ewnupdates pic.twitter.com/xutlTmDZUk The department said the 711 learners at the school couldn’t write their mid-year exams on Tuesday morning and were subsequently sent home because the school was torched. Basic Education spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga said millions will be needed to repair the schools and this is a serious setback for the very community who did the damage. “We [the Department of Basic Education] appeal to [the South Africa Police Service] to track down these hooligans, lock them up, put them on trial and jail them for many years. It can’t go on like this. It’s pure criminal,” he tweeted. @Mpueducation @DBE_SA The 711 learners at this Primary School couldn’t write exams this morning.

We bought 77 for R22-million in 2016. Education has suffered a R3,5-billion cut for infrastructure.” eNCA
