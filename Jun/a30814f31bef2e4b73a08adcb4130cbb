PRETORIA – Minister of Police Bheki Cele is rolling out a massive increase in visible policing in provinces worst affected by crime. Cele and National Police Commissioner Khehla Sitole unveiled a new crime-fighting strategy in Pretoria on Monday. Police are under pressure to crack down on the rise in violent cash-in-transit (CITs) heists and other crimes.

This would entail the immigration of resources from the strategic framework level to an operational framework level. This means that in provinces like Gauteng, KZN and Western Cape which are provinces most affected by the crime wave will be boosted by the deployment of lieutenant-generals. "We will also mobilise police members ordinarily tasked with admin duties to augment the visibility of police in identified hotspots in the provinces. Our intention is to combat crimes among others, CITs, hijackings, murders, house robberies, gang violence, taxi violence and related crimes," Cele said. Meanwhile, National Police Commissioner Khehla Sitole said police officers found to be involved in criminal acts will be dealt with.

The moment we find that anyone of them is involved, that policeman is no longer part of us. We flush them out. We take them off the system. "Our intelligence is tasked to look into such members who might be implicated. The message is that we take our own uniform and give them orange uniform,” Sitole said. eNCA
