LOS ANGELES - The ocean is considered to be the origin and the engine of all life on this planet and right now it is under threat. Beset by habitat destruction, overfishing and pollution, the ocean is losing the ability to provide the benefits that humans have come to rely on. Parley AIR is a proposed strategy to end marine plastic pollution, an initiative that allows people to pledge to help save the ocean and which advocates education and collaborative projects.

The ocean currents have formed five gigantic, slow-moving whirlpools where the plastic collects, nicknamed Vortex. Recent studies indicate that at least five trillion pieces weighing over 250,000 tons are now floating in the world's oceans. The majority of the plastic debris sinks or remains in the Vortices, however, a significant percentage of it washes onto our coastlines daily. After sunlight photodegrades the plastic into small pieces, aquatic life and seabirds mistake these fragments for food and ingest it.
