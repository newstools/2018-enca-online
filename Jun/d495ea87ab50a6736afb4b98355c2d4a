"Thank you guys, thank you to the coach and thanks to (President Vladimir) Putin for this celebration! It's great." "This today was the national team that we all want to see," Sports Minister Pavel Kolobkov was quoted as saying by TASS news agency. "Putin is also in shock," the TV Rain channel wrote on social media, posting a photograph of the Russian president watching the game from a box in the stands with his arms raised in surprise.

"This is really cool," Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny, who was released from jail earlier in the day, wrote on social media. "I had no doubts before the game, the question was only what the score would be," a TV host said on a live talk show on Channel One to cheers from the studio. Reuters
