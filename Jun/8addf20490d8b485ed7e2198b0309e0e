JOHANNESBURG - Bafana Bafana coach Stuart Baxter is determined to put the Madagascar debacle behind him and give all players a chance in the Cosafa Cup Plate final against Botswana in at the Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane on Friday. Baxter said on Wednesday he will continue to rotate his squad as he looks to give his young players as much exposure to international football as possible. The coach will definitely be without suspended midfielder Fortune Makaringe, who has two yellow cards in the tournament and could well recall forward Luther Singh. IN MEMES: We lost to Madagascar?? “We want everybody to have played if we can. The young ones that we think need that international experience, we will give them that. That is why I put Lyle (Foster) on for the final 10 minutes because I think he needed that,” Baxter said. “You want to win the game, it’s a final, but you certainly want to make sure you stay true to yourself because otherwise, you will keep bouncing backwards and forwards and never get the experience for the players that need it.” Singh did not play in Tuesday’s 4-1 victory over Namibia after his high-profile misses in the quarterfinal defeat against Madagascar, but Baxter hinted he is keen to give him another chance. “This camp is not about allowing people one game and then throwing them on the scrap heap,” Baxter said. “It is about learning lessons and gaining experience. “If Luther learns his lesson, he will get another chance, but if we continue to make those mistakes and errors in judgement, then it is correct that other people get in ahead of you. “I am not smacking people on their fingers. We are not school teachers, we will give everybody a chance to learn.” African News Agency
