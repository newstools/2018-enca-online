JOHANNESBURG – Social media was abuzz on Saturday afternoon following France’s 4-3 victory against Argentine with the subject of the day being Lionel Messi. The Barcelona forward did not have a good campaign in Russia, culminating in his team experiencing a spectacular crash out of the World Cup at the hands of France. Speculation is rife that he might opt to retire from international football after the France game. If he does indeed retire, his great career would see him without an international trophy following a 1-0 loss to Germany in Brazil four years ago. Messi has already lost the three finals in the Copa America. He retired from international football in 2016, only to reverse his decision ahead of this year’s World Cup qualifying games. As the “Little Napoleon” failed to inspire his team past France Twitter was having a field day. However, there are some who went all out to defend Messi as the Messi/Ronaldo debate intensified. eNCA
