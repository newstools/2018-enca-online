This as a province has been well led and ultimately we have shown the people of the Western Cape what good governance looks like," said Maimane. "We’ve demonstrated to the people of South Africa the fact that where the DA governs, unemployment decreases and in fact, many of our governments here are experiencing clean audits," he said.
