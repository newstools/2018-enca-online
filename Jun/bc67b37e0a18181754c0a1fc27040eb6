As a policeman, it’s my natural instinct to react and I noticed the vehicle had turned at a high speed and come to a standstill and noticed a black male jumping out of the vehicle and running. "As an instinct I knew it was a hijacked vehicle. Someone in the neighbourhood screamed and told me it was a hijacked vehicle. I gave chase and apprehended the black male, the driver of the vehicle,” he said. WATCH: Passenger tells of fatal hijacking in Durban Murder accused Sibonelo Mkhize’s case is currently before court.
