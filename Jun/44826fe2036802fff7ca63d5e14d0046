MADRID - Spain coach Julen Lopetegui has been sacked, two days before their opening World Cup match against Portugal. Real Madrid announced on Tuesday that Lopetegui, who had only recently extended his contract with Spain, would take over as their coach next season. The RFEF then said that Lopetegui would leave his job with Spain after the World Cup. But multiple media reports on Wednesday said that RFEF president Luis Rubiales was so angry at Lopetegui's conduct that he was prepared to fire him immediately. Spain are unbeaten in 20 matches since Lopetegui took over following Euro 2016. AFP
