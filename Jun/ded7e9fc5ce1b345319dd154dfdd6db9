ADDIS ABABA – South Sudan President Salva Kiir will meet with rebel leader Riek Machar in Ethiopia's capital on Wednesday in their first face-to-face in nearly two years, an Ethiopian official said Tuesday.

South Sudan's ambassador to Ethiopia, James Pitia Morgan, confirmed Kiir's planned attendance, as did Manasseh Zindo, a senior official in Machar's SPLM-IO rebel group. The two leaders, whose political rivalry triggered the start of a civil war more than four years ago have not met since Machar and his forces were chased from the capital during fighting in July 2016. Successive international efforts – led by regional bloc IGAD – have so far failed to impose a functioning peace deal or meaningful ceasefire.

Tens of thousands have died and nearly four million South Sudanese have been driven from their homes since December 2013, while millions are going hungry amid a massive humanitarian crisis. Last month the UN Security Council gave the warring sides a month to reach a peace deal or face sanctions. AFP
