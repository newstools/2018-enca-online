Looking at Paris, this is the first time we were in a tough pool and we managed to win two games and lose out on points difference. The HSBC sevens world series table at the end. SA pips Fiji by just 2 points and #Kenya7s comes 8th and for the first time we get more than 100 points. Exciting season - we did a great job. With more support the boys will be amazing next season #TeamKenya pic.twitter.com/MM1KaRaYSt “We were in another tough pool in London and raised our hand. If we would have managed to get to the quarters we would have been talking about something else. ” African News Agency
