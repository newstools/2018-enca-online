		What a talent! pic.twitter.com/ClARixNv4h Kerr's 232 is the third-highest individual score by a man or woman in one-day international cricket history. India men's player Rohit Sharma is at the top of the pile with his 264 scored against Sri Lanka in 2014. New Zealand's Martin Guptill made 237 against West Indies in 2015. At 17 years and 243 days, Kerr is the youngest double-centurion in international men's or women's cricket. Kerr then starred with the ball, the leg-spinner taking five for 17 in seven overs as New Zealand's women went on to beat Ireland by 305 runs after dismissing the hosts for 135 in Dublin. Victory saw the White Ferns complete a 3-0 series sweep over Ireland, with every one of those wins by colossal margins of over 300 runs. AFP
