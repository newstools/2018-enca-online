CAIRO - Mo Salah appeared with the rest of Egypt squad at a final training session in Cairo before flying to Russia on Sunday for the country's first World Cup appearance in 28 years. The 25-year-old has not played since injuring his right shoulder in Liverpool's Champions League final defeat to Real Madrid last month and is considered a doubt for Egypt's Group A opener against Uruguay on Friday.

Salah posed for selfies and grinned alongside the national team's mascot, a green "Nile crocodile", and was then pictured on board the plane which took manager Hector Cuper's squad to their base in Grozny.
