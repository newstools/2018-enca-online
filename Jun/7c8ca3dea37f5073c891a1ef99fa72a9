JOHANNESBURG â€“ Eskom will on Thursday respond to unions on their latest counter-offer tabled by unions after workers rejected a 4,7 percent wage hike. READ: Eskom tables new wage offer Employees at the cash-strapped utility put on a united front with employers after they consolidated their mandates. But unions, including the National Union of Mineworkers of South Africa (Numsa), Solidarity and National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), refused to give an exact figure. However, the NUM said it had no option but for unions to unite.
