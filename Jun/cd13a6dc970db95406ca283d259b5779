		Your move, Leo. pic.twitter.com/G3TnIKEDCU Chhetri, who thanked the crowd on turning out in numbers after he had posted a video message last week on Twitter seeking fan support at India matches, played down comparisons with Messi. "I am not taking that too seriously. There is no comparison (with Messi). I am a big fan (of him) and happy scoring goals for the country," Chhetri, who scored eight goals in the four-nation tournament, said after the win. "We want to win matches, we want to win trophies for the country. We are in the ascendancy right now. It's just the start. Hope we could get more games and prepare for 2019 Asia Cup." The national team are 97th in the FIFA rankings, having risen from 166th in 2015 when English coach Stephen Constantine was appointed. But cricket dominates Indian sport and they are number one in the Test rankings. Chhetri's heartfelt appeal last week was backed by India's cricket heroes Virat Kohli and Sachin Tendulkar after just 2,569 people turned up for India's opening game on June 1. India beat Taiwan (5-0) and then Kenya (3-0) before losing to New Zealand (1-2) in the league phase. AFP
