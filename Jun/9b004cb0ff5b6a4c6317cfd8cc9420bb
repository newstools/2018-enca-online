JOHANNESBURG - Eskom confirmed stage one load-shedding will go ahead on Friday, a day after South African football fans tuned into the opening of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Eskom anticipates that load-shedding will continue until 9pm on Friday night, due to the impact of the current illegal protest by employees over wage increases. The power utility says they are working with all relevant stakeholders to keep their plants operating optimally and that there is a high risk of load-shedding over the weekend. South African soccer fans expressed their shock and disappointment on social media. They fear missing most of the action at the latest edition of the tournament in Russia. Social media users were left asking if it could merely be a coincidence or if load-shedding occurs every time a World Cup comes around. Load shedding and the world cup.

Customers are cautioned to treat all electrical connections as live during this period. eNCA
