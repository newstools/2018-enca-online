MANCHESTER, England - England beat Australia by one wicket in the fifth One Day International in Manchester on Sunday to secure a 5-0 series whitewash. The slowest yet surely the finest ODI hundred of Jos Buttler’s burgeoning career stirred the hearts and minds of a raucous Manchester crowd as England secured a 5-0 scoreline against Australia for the first time in limited-overs history. No one who was there will ever forget it, not least Tim Paine, who must have thought when England slumped to 114/8 in search of 206 that he would finally grab his first win as Australia captain. Buttler though is compiling a bulging portfolio of match-defining knocks. That’s six ODI centuries now – with this one on Sunday, off 122 balls, comfortably the most measured of his half-dozen, by 39 deliveries in fact – while he’s striking at a rate of 134 in T20Is, vice-captain of the one-day teams, a fine wicketkeeper, and now, at 27, a world star with something like the profile and reputation to prove it. “That one stung,” Paine was able to mutter at the death. “When we’ve been under pressure in this series we haven’t responded.” African News Agency
