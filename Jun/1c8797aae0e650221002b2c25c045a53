CAPE TOWN - Severe storms lashed Cape Town and other parts of the drought-stricken Western Cape overnight, leading to flooding in places and hopes that dams in the region would have received a significant boost. The City of Cape Town's Disaster Management Centre reported extensive flooding in northern suburbs such as Goodwood, Parow, Ravensmead, Belhar and Bellville South. A cold front has also resulted in gale-force winds.
