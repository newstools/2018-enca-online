CAPE TOWN - Severe storms lashed Cape Town and other parts of the drought-stricken Western Cape overnight, leading to flooding in places and hopes that dams in the region would have received a significant boost. A very chilly day tomorrow over western South Africa following the passage of a cold front. An 80% chance of rain early on Friday in the west. #eNCA pic.twitter.com/c0Ojkd70uP The City of Cape Town's Disaster Management Centre reported extensive flooding in northern suburbs such as Goodwood, Parow, Ravensmead, Belhar and Bellville South. A cold front has also resulted in gale-force winds. READ: Powerful cold front to bring heavy rain to the Cape The City's Charlotte Powell said: "Approximately 150 residential properties have been affected. Roofs have been blown off in Sir Lowry's Pass Village and a few properties have been damaged. Trees have been uprooted in Parow, Goodwood, Constantia and Belhar areas. "Power lines came down in Goodwood, Parow Valley, Langa, Bergvliet, Durbanville and Maitland areas,” she said. “Mudslides have been reported in the Hout Bay area,” Powell added.

The City’s parks department on Friday morning removed uprooted trees across the metropole to ensure roadways were clear while the roads and stormwater drains were also unblocked. Disaster management officials are still assessing the situation.
