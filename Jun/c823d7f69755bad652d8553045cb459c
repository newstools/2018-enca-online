MOSCOW - Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo headed his team to a 1-0 victory over Morocco in their World Cup Group B match on Wednesday to put them in the driving seat for a spot in the next round and seal the North Africans' early exit.

The result put Portugal top of the group with four points and meant Morocco, who had a string of clear scoring chances in the second half, became the first team to be eliminated from the tournament following their second loss. Portugal, who drew 3-3 in their opener against Spain, next play Iran on Monday. Reuters
