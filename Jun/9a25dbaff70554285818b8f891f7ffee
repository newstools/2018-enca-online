WELLINGTON - An early red card to France fullback Ben Fall ensured the All Blacks sealed a 26-13 victory in the second test at Wellington Regional Stadium on Saturday and wrapped up the three-match series with a game to spare. Fall, who arrived late in New Zealand due to the Top 14 final and missed the 52-11 first test loss, was sent off by Australian referee Angus Gardner in the 12th minute for taking out All Blacks flyhalf Beauden Barrett in the air.

Scrumhalf Morgan Parra slotted two first-half penalties for the visitors, who dominated for long periods of the game and earned the most plaudits when prop Cedate Gomes Sa scored after the full-time hooter.
