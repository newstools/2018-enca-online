PRETORIA - The Kingdom Stars edged the Limpopo Baobabs 50-46 in their Netball Premier League match at the Pretoria University Sports Centre on Saturday. At the first interval, the Stars led 15-12, but the Baobabs came storming back in the second quarter. Goal-shooter Grace Lechaba scored 12 goals from 12 attempts and the Baobabs won the quarter by 14 goals to eight to lead 26-23 at halftime. The Stars won the third quarter by 16 goals to eight, to lead 39-34 and it appeared to be all over for the Limpopo team. However, they fought hard again in the final quarter and with two minutes left were just one goal behind the Stars. The Stars pulled out all the stops and scored four consecutive goals to take the match. “You live for matches like this,” said Baobabs coach Jenne-lee Delport. “It was quite a rollercoaster. I was so proud of the way they came back in the second quarter, but there were a few unforced errors that cost us. My goalshooters are both teenagers and I think the pressure in the final few minutes was just too much for them.” Stars coach Madri Maritz said she had expected a very tough match from the Stars. “I was very worried when they were just one goal behind, with two minutes to go. But my girls have a fighting spirit and I was proud of the way they never gave up,” said Maritz. In the first match of the day, the Northern Cape Diamonds put on their best performance of the tournament so far against the Mpumalanga Sunbirds. The Sunbirds won 43-34, but victory was never assured until the final whistle. “It was our best performance and I am very pleased with the team,” said Diamonds coach Elfreda Luyt. “Our shooters are coming right and our defence was very good.” “Things didn’t go as planned but I am very happy with the win,” said Sunbirds coach Marlie Nel.
