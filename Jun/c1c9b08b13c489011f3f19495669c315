JOHANNESBURG - South Africa’s economy was in worse shape in the first quarter of 2018 than what economists expected. The country’s current account deficit widened to 4,8 percent of GDP from January to the end of March. South Africa's current account deficit is at its highest level since the 4,9 percent seen in the first quarter of 2016. READ: Does the current account deficit matter? The Reserve Bank's latest quarterly bulletin shows the value of net gold and merchandise exports decreased much more than that of imports. The central bank says the drop in mineral exports was also due to iron ore and coal, which were affected by the derailment of a train transporting iron ore to the Saldanha harbour. The shortfall was also partly attributed to the rand’s rise at the start of the year following the surge of optimism surrounding Cyril Ramaphosa’s election as president. While the political changes resulted in an upswing in business and consumer confidence, it also made South African exports more expensive and lowered demand. Core inflation slowed to a six-year low of 4-point-one percent in March, while consumer price inflation also moved upwards in April, following the VAT increase and higher fuel prices. Despite economic headwinds, experts still expect much better economic growth this year. Iaan Venter, SA Reserve Bank Economist, says: “The expectation is still that overall growth will be much better than last year. I don’t think this first quarter number will be repeated hopefully. It was a surprise. Maybe the expectations will be lowered a bit.” It’s hoped that sectors like manufacturing will pick up in the coming months, which would help increase exports and job creation. eNCA
