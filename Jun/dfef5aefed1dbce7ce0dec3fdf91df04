Sarb said that test packs of the commemorative banknotes had already been made available to members of the broader cash industry to allow them to make adequate preparations in relation to issues such as adaptions of cash processing and cash dispensing machines, ticketing machines and so forth. It is envisaged that these notes will be issued into circulation by 18 July, the centenary of the former stateman's birth.
