JOHANNESBURG – Unions have had mixed reactions following Eskom's latest wage offer. The power utility on Tuesday moved from a no-increase position to an offer of 4.7 percent. Workers went on strike last week demanding a 15 percent hike, resulting in Eskom implementing load-shedding. Following an intervention by Public Enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan, the parties went back to the negotiating table. READ: Eskom says load-shedding likely on Tuesday The National Union of Metalworkers (Numsa) said it is not happy with the way Eskom resumed wage negotiations as some members of the parastatal's board were not present. "I must say we have not been happy in that we met with the minister who put negotiations back on track. We wanted delegations from the Eskom board, management, unions etc... We are extremely disappointed by what appeared to be by Eskom management and the board not taking this process seriously, there’s nothing special about them," said Numsa's general secretary Irvin Jim. READ: NUM says Eskom lying over 'sabotage' claims Solidarity's Deon Reyneke said the union welcomes the wage offer but that it will have to discuss the matter with its members first before taking a decision. "From the Solidarity side, as the collective labour has said, the 4.7 percent is moving to the right direction. We're still waiting for the response with regard to different aspects of IPPs (independent power producers) as Mr Jim said." Watch the full reaction below. eNCA
