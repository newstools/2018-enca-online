JOHANNESBURG -  The Springbok Sevens squad returned to South Africa on Tuesday as World Rugby Sevens Series champions after they clinched the title in dramatic fashion in Paris on Sunday. The speedsters have won the World Rugby Sevens Series for the second consecutive season. It was also the third time the Blitzboks had won the World Rugby Series after they were crowned champions for the first time in the 2008/09 season.

And they have arrived #SevensWorldSeriesChamps pic.twitter.com/ZrjB7OvfIf “This was such a memorable series. We feel for Fiji, who came charging and overhauled us with three tournaments to go, only to come up short in Paris, but that is sport for you.” “We kept the focus on ourselves and what we wanted to achieve as a squad and a system,” Powell said. The coach was particularly pleased in expanding the player base and used 28 players during the season – a busy one for Sevens Rugby with the Commonwealth Games, World Series and Rugby World Cup Sevens on the calendar.

We still have the Rugby World Cup Sevens in San Francisco in July, so after a short break, we will start preparing for that.” The coach confirmed that leading scorer, Cecil Afrika, has been ruled out of their July trip to the USA, due to a serious hamstring injury sustained in London. Kyle Brown, who injured his knee in Singapore, was also ruled out of next month’s showpiece. *Additional reporting ANA eNCA
