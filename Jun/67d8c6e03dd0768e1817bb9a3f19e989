SPONSORED CONTENT Crossing the Line This gripping documentary reveals Australia’s toxic cricket culture during the infamous 2018 tour during which the Aussies were found guilty of ball tampering. In Crossing the Line the test series unfolds more like a soap opera than a sport event. With commentary from cricketing legends including Shaun Pollock, Graeme Smith, Michael Holding and Shane Warne, the documentary shows why things boiled over on and off the pitch and includes behind-the-scenes footage of the players confronting each other. Watch it here. During the series, AB de Villiers posted online with a premonition that clearly came true. This series will be one to remember AB de Villiers And that’s the perfect segue into the next documentary to watch, simply titled AB de Villiers. Over 14 years, AB has played 228 ODIs, 114 tests and 78 T20 matches. He holds three world records for scoring the fastest 50, 100 and 150 ever seen in an ODI. AB will go down in history as one of the greatest players the game has ever seen, and it was a sad day for cricket fans worldwide when the legendary South African batsman posted a video on Twitter announcing his retirement from international cricket in May this year.
