JOHANNESBURG - Safety patrollers protested outside the office of the Gauteng Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane on Wednesday. They say Nkosi-Malobane has not fulfilled her promises to pay them a stipend. The patrollers claim they signed contracts in 2016 and that the Community Safety MEC has been avoiding them for two years.
