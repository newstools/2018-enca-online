PARIS - Spain's Rafael Nadal regained the top spot in the men's ATP rankings from old rival Roger Federer on Monday after the latter's surprise final loss on the grass in Halle. Nadal had slipped down to number two despite his 11th French Open success after Federer, 36, took the Stuttgart Cup to bag the number one ranking for the sixth time in his career and bask in a record 310th week at the summit.
