JOHANNESBURG – Cricket SA (CSA) and the SA Cricketers’ Association (Saca) on Friday jointly announced a one-week delay in the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the two parties. The agreement, which covers the next four-year period, will be signed off by July 6, 2018. The MOU18 agreement replaces the interim agreement that was put in place in April this year. “Negotiations have taken place in a positive and constructive spirit,” said CSA acting chief executive Thabang Moroe. "It is important that the drafting process is very thorough as it covers virtually every aspect of professional cricket for both men and women over the next four years, involving not just CSA and Saca, but the franchises and provinces as well.” Tony Irish, SACA chief executive, commented: “A lot of progress has been made since CSA and Saca signed an Interim agreement at the end of April and we have consensus on virtually all of the key aspects.
