"One of the suspects, a 16-year-old juvenile, pointed a firearm at the complainant and demanded her personal belongings. The complainant, who was on her way to get a taxi in Mew Way road, handed over her belongings. The 16-year-old was arrested and charged the same day at [10pm]. A case of robbery with a firearm is under investigation," van Wyk said. In an unrelated incident, a 28-year-old man from Harare in Khayelitsha was arrested for attempted arson after "pouring petrol next to his girlfriendâ€™s house and car". "On Monday, just after [8:30pm], an argument between the couple led to the suspect leaving the address and returning with five litres of petrol. The suspect was prevented by a family member from setting the property on fire. A case was registered and the suspect was arrested and charged on Tuesday." A police vehicle control point (VCP) set up at 12.30pm on Tuesday led to the arrest of two suspects in possession of stolen cables. The two men, aged 32 and 39, were stopped at the VCP and police searched their vehicle, a silver Opel Astra.
