• Editor's note: This live event has ended. You may watch a recording above. JOHANNESBURG – Tebogo Job Mokgoro will be sworn in as North West premier on Friday. He succeeds Supra Mahumapelo, who resigned last month following violent protests in the province. Mahumapelo is pledging his support for his successor. 70-year-old Mokgoro is a former director-general of the province's government. EFF member Alfred Motsi was removed from the legislature after the party complained that the ANC was wasting their time. They wanted a copy of Mahumapelo's resignation before proceeding. #PremierMokgoro EFF MPLs have black arm bends on, in honour of those "who were killed during #SupraMustGo protests."@eNCA eNCA
