PORT ELIZABETH – Australia’s Jackson Baker was crowned SA Open Surfing champion at Pollock Beach in Port Elizabeth on Saturday. His opponent, Adin Masencamp took the early lead with a 5.67 wave but was left trailing in Baker’s wake when the Australian ripped through a right-hand bomb to bank an excellent 8.00. “Adin got the first wave; he got a five and then this one big wave came and I just knew I had to stay on my feet but I got to the end section, dropped an eight so I knew I was in the driver’s seat,” said Baker. Baker then quickly backed his eight up with a score of 3.83 that remained stuck in his top two until three minutes before the end, when he found a 5.33 to extend his lead over the South African. Masencamp fought hard but was unable to close the gap. With 90 seconds left on the clock, Masencamp needed 7.67 for a win but it did not materialise. This was Masencamp’s fourth final in the six-event City Surf Series; and the achievement that earned him a coveted wildcard entry into the biggest QS-rated event in Africa, taking place in Durban next week. Two South Africans, Nicole Pallet and Tanika Hoffman are through to the women’s QS3000 round of 16 that starts on Sunday morning. African News Agency
