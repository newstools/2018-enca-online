MOSCOW - Banned former FIFA president Sepp Blatter will fly to Moscow on Tuesday to visit the soccer World Cup and meet Russian President Vladimir Putin, his spokesman told Reuters. Blatter, who led FIFA for 17 years, is currently serving a six-year ban for unethical conduct after soccer's world governing body was rocked by a global corruption scandal in 2015. The ban was imposed shortly after the Swiss attorney general's office began criminal proceedings against him on suspicion of criminal mismanagement and misappropriation. No charges have yet been brought and Blatter has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.
