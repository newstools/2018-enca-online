LONDON - US tech giant Microsoft has submerged a data centre off the Orkney archipelago in northern Scotland in a project to save on the energy used to cool the servers on land. The company said on Wednesday that the Northern Isles data centre consists of a 12.2-metre-long white cylinder containing 864 servers -- enough to store five million movies. It can lie on the seabed for up to five years.

"By putting data centres in bodies of water near coastal cities, data would have a short distance to travel to reach coastal communities," it said. The sea offers ready and free access to cooling -- which is one of the biggest costs for land-based data centres. It is also far quicker to deploy a data centre offshore than build on land. The downside is that if the computers on board break, they cannot be repaired. The data centre is also very small compared with the giant warehouses used to store the world's information. The cylinder was built in France by shipbuilding company Naval and then driven to the Orkney Islands, an archipelago of around 70 islands. AFP
