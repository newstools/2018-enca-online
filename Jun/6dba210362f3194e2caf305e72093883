GA-RANKUWA - A group of children with lower limb amputations have realised their dreams of running around a playground. That's thanks to three organisations, that are joining forces to improve the lives of African children, living with amputations. Experts from Tanzania, Zimbabwe and Mozambique are in Johannesburg for an upskilling workshop, centred on prosthetics. In the process, several children have received sports prosthetic legs.

He's had prosthetic legs before but says these ones make him feel equal to everyone else. “They showed me that I’m not disabled, I’m just a person like them, and I must have fun with them. They made me comfortable,” said Mofokeng. Tebogo says he was teased at school, forcing him to drop out and enrol at a school for people living with disabilities. “They took me to a school for people with mental disabilities and I thought to myself, why did they take me to such a school? I thought I should just stay at home, rather than attend a school for people with psychological difficulties." Tebogo's new limbs were made possible by a pilot programme, aimed at helping SADC countries support children, who are living with lower limb amputations. Jumping Kids, a non-profit organisation providing prosthetics for children, says the limbs enable body development. Without having to worry about their mobility, these children have the freedom to dream and are being encouraged to become whatever they want to be. Tebogo is aiming to be South Africa's next star Paralympic athlete. eNCA
