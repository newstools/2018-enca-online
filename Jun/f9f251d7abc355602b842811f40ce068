MACOMIA, Mozambique – Attacks on coastal communities have triggered a massive displacement of people to the Quirimbas archipelago, described by tour operators as "breathtakingly beautiful" and popular with tourists for its diving reefs and whale and dolphins sightings. Others have fled to the provincial capital Pemba or Macomia, another town. The islands are ill-equipped to handle an influx and have no schools or hospitals, raising the spectre of a humanitarian crisis. "This place has made it easier to escape the danger we faced," said Atanasio Nacir, a teacher from Naunde who had taken refuge in an administrative building. More than 30 people have been killed attacks since last month and many more injured - but no one knows how many been displaced by the violence. Attackers recently killed and beheaded seven villagers, prompting more than half of its 2,300 people to flee. "The village school had 378 students - but now pupils are scattered in different places and we don't know where," said the teacher who added that the crisis had forced the school to close.

"What we need most are tents to house the people whose houses were burned down," Maurice Miranda, a village leader in Naunde, told AFP. "There are families here who have lost their homes, they are sleeping under the trees. We have not received any help yet". AFP
