DURBAN - A ten-year-old girl has been rescued from what has been described as a house of horrors in Verulam, north of Durban. It is alleged the girl’s step-father raped her repeatedly after imprisoning her since the age of five. This neighbour rescued the girl. She tells me what the child told her. She’d been living with her stepfather after her mother’s death a few years ago. #ChildRape pic.twitter.com/BEG9G4Gt1I Neighbours say these items - a variety of sex toys - were found inside the house. #ChildRape pic.twitter.com/yRWG0I5FhY Almost 12 hours after the suspect was found, detectives have arrived and are cordoning off the crime scene.
