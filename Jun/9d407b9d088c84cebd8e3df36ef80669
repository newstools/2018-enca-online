DURBAN - A ten-year-old girl has been rescued from what has been described as a house of horrors in Verulam, north of Durban. It is alleged the girl’s step-father raped her repeatedly after imprisoning her since the age of five. Almost 12 hours after the suspect was found, detectives have arrived and are cordoning off the crime scene. Residents have entered and exited the room freely since last night. They’ve also removed and stored evidence. #ChildRape pic.twitter.com/DI9CdEdxXl It is believed a neighbour came to her rescue after hearing her being beaten on Monday night. Residents in the area apprehended the man after the child revealed what had been happening. The community believes the suspect has escaped from hospital. They’ve confronted police who returned to the scene. We are still awaiting confirmation on this from @SAPoliceService. #ChildRape pic.twitter.com/0EEQx5dcaN This is the room in which a ten-year-old Durban girl was allegedly held captive and raped by her step-father for months.
