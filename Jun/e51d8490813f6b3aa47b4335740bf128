JOHANNESBURG – South African soccer legends have called on the police to up their game to ensure the killers of former Bafana Bafana captain, Senzo Meyiwa are brought to book. The players were participating in a soccer event to commemorate Meyiwa's life at the King Zwelithini stadium in Umlazi. Meyiwa was shot in 2014. Since then, no one has been arrested. Soccer lovers came out in their numbers to remember slain soccer star, Meyiwa. Bafana Bafana's much-loved captain was shot while visiting his girlfriend in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni.

Meyiwa’s family is still confident Senzo’s killers will be found. “I’m positive because Minister Cele is a very hard working person, the same as Minister Mbalula. They're both hard-working individuals. So ever since Cele came in, I can sleep easy,” said Meyiwa's father, Sam. The organisers have vowed to make the Meyiwa game an annual event. eNCA
