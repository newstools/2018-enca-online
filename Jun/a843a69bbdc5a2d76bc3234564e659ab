THE HAGUE - The International Criminal Court on Friday overturned the war crimes conviction of Congolese politician Jean-Pierre Bemba on appeal. Presiding judge Christine Van den Wijngaert said that Bemba could not be held responsible for atrocities carried out by troops under his control in the neighbouring Central African Republic, and those trial judges had failed to consider the efforts he made to stop crimes once he became aware of them.
