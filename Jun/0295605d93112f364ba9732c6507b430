JOHANNESBURG – The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) on Monday accused Eskom of lying to the public for saying workers affiliated to the trade union were responsible for sabotage at power stations across the country. Eskom began implementing load-shedding late last week when workers went on strike over the power utility's announcement that there would be no wage increases this year. The parastatal said some workers were responsible for sabotage and intimidation, leading to the first rolling blackouts in South Africa since 2015. LOAD-SHEDDING: Schedules, info, and how it affects you NUM spokesperson Livhuwani Mammburu denied this. "We also want to clarify the lies being communicated to the public by Eskom that our members are responsible for load-shedding. Eskom is lying and our members are not even responsible for any sabotage," Mammburu said.

Eskom management must deal with their own problems and stop blaming the workers." Eskom wage negotiations will resume on Tuesday and continue until Thursday after Minister of Public Enterprises Pravin Gordhan intervened, and the power utility removed the zero percent wage offer from the table.
