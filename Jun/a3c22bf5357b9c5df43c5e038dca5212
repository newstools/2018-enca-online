CAPE TOWN – South African captain Siya Kolisi admitted defeat was a tough pill to swallow after his off-the-pace side went down 25-10 to England at Newlands, in Cape Town, on Saturday. The Stormers flank was helpless as his home debut with the armband went from bad to worse as England proved to be far superior in all key facets. “It was really tough out there and there was a noticeable drop in intensity,” said Kolisi, after watching his side turn in a meek performance. The post-match numbers reflect Kolisi’s stance with the Springboks committing 14 penalties, 13 handling errors and nine turnovers. “We made a lot of mistakes and obviously, the discipline wasn’t good.” It wasn’t all doom and gloom with the Springbok captain seeing a positive trend week on week as the new side continues to grow as a unit. “This week aside, we’ve really gotten better and better and you know, the more time we spend together, the better we get.” Kolisi admitted that England did well to control the pace of the game with his side preferring a higher tempo, something that will be the focus as they prepare for the Rugby Championship. “We need to keep our intensity and control how we want to play. We didn’t do that today and it showed. It was quite slow out there and it suited England, so that’s something to work on.” African News Agency
