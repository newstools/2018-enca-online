NIZHNIY NOVGOROD, Russia - Angel Di Maria was left out as under-pressure Argentina made three changes to their starting line-up as they went in search of a much-needed win in their Group D game against Croatia on Thursday. Coach Jorge Sampaoli drafted in Gabriel Mercado in defence to replace Marcos Rojo, and Enzo Perez and Marcos Acuna were chosen in midfield instead of Lucas Biglia and Paris Saint-Germain star Di Maria. Surprisingly, Sampaoli left Cristian Pavon on the bench after the young Boca Juniors forward was widely predicted to play. Up front are Lionel Messi, Sergio Aguero and Maximiliano Meza. Argentina need a victory in Nizhny Novgorod after surprisingly drawing their first game 1-1 against Iceland. Croatia, who beat Nigeria 2-0 to top the early group standings, made just one change, bringing in Inter Milan midfielderÂ Marcelo Brozovic for striker Andrej Kramaric.
