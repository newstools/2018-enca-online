JOHANNESBURG – The Black Business Council (BBC) said on Monday that the appointment of Madoda Mxakwe as group CEO at the South African Broadcasting Corporation  (SABC) would bring much-needed stability after a long leadership vacuum at the public broadcaster. Mxakwe's appointment would also allow the SABC to speed up the process of digital migration, BBC CEO Kganki Matabane said.
