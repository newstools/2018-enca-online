ABUJA – Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday signed the 2018 budget into law, more than six months after it was first presented to parliament. Buhari approved the 9.1-trillion-naira ($25 billion) spending plan, which is designed to boost economic growth after the country's worst recession in over two decades. He wrote on Twitter that he had signed it "in order not to further slow down the pace of recovery of our economy, which has doubtlessly been affected by the delay in passing the budget". But he said he was "concerned" about some of the changes the National Assembly made to the proposals he first presented back in November last year.

Delays in passing government budgets have become a feature in Nigeria but experts said it had already done damage. "The economy has been operating rather in a rudderless manner," said economist Eze Onyekpere, from the Centre for Social Justice in Abuja.

"Through successive governments, this is where Nigeria's record has been especially poor... there is no reason to assume this time around that all of the spending plans will necessarily be executed," Khan said. Buhari, 75, is seeking a second term in office at elections scheduled for February 2019. Khan said the vote will also detract from efforts to diversify Nigeria's economy away from its dependence on oil. AFP
