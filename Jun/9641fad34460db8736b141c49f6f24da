Last year, Kenyaâ€™s former governor warned that close to 40,000 buildings were at risk of collapsing. It was not immediately clear what caused the collapse in the central Huduma district. "Until now, three people have lost their lives. Two were pulled out of the rubble in the morning and about an hour ago another man was found in the rubble," the Mathare County's Deputy Commissioner Patrick Mwangi told reporters. Pius Maasai, head of the police department's disaster management, said residents have been advised to vacate buildings deemed unsafe. "(A) decision has been made that some of them will be knocked down straight away," he said. In June last year, two people died after a seven-storey block fell down in Nairobi's poor southern Pipeline Estate. A year earlier, 49 people were killed when their building collapsed during a heavy, night-time downpour in a poor neighbourhood. eNCA
