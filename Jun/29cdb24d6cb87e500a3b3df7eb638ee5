CAPE TOWN - The large storm heading for Cape Town this weekend not only brings with it huge swell and strong winds but also a torrent of stellar surfing as the Jordy Smith Cape Town Surf Pro, starts on Friday running until Sunday. With top riders from Brazil, Australia, the USA, New Zealand, France, Japan, Reunion and Germany set to paddle out alongside the cream of South African surfing, this World Surfing League (WSL) Qualifying Series (QS)-rated event has all the elements of a top competition. The primary contest venue is Big Bay at Bloubergstrand, but with roaming beach permissions and a significant storm swell pushing in; Melkbosstrand is the likely option for Friday’s action. The top five seeds in the Men’s QS1000 event consist of three South Africans and two Australians; Jordan Lawler, who was runner-up to Jordy Maree at the second City Surf Series stop in Port Alfred, and Liam O’Brien. Durban’s David van Zyl will be looking to add a second 2018 City Surf Series (CSS) title to his win at the first series stop in Nelson Mandela Bay. Matthew McGillivray from Jeffreys Bay is currently ranked tenth on the WSL QS tour and South Africa’s most recent WSL QS event winner. A win in Cape Town will contribute 1000 points towards his 2019 WSL Championship Tour (CT) campaign and edge him closer to joining Jordy Smith and Michael February on the dream tour. The Mother City’s hopes are pinned on Strand local, Adin Masencamp who won at the fourth CSS series stop in Durban, and current CSS Skull Candy ratings leader, Jordy Maree. African News Agency
