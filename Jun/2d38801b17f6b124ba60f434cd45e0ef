JOHANNESBURG - Government wants to raise black mine ownership to 30-percent over the next five years.
	
	This is one of the targets in a revised draft mining charter which was released for public comment yesterday by Minister of Mineral Resources Gwede Mantashe. It replaces the controversial charter released a year ago by Mantashe’s predecessor, Mosebenzi Zwane. READ: Mantashe moves to have Mining Charter agreement in three months Mining companies agreed to postpone a legal challenge to Zwane’s charter after President Cyril Ramaphosa said he was committed to finding a solution to the dispute. The new draft gives existing mine permit holders five years, instead of one year, to meet the new black ownership requirement. It also addresses a dispute under the previous charter over companies in which black investors have sold their shares. Such a company will now be seen as  BEE compliant and has five years to reach 30-percent black ownership. New Draft Charter -     Existing permit holders have five years to meet black ownership requirement -     If black shareholders sell shares, company remains compliant -     At least 50% of seats on boards reserved for black South Africans -     1% profits paid to employees and communities -     70% of procurement budget spent on goods made in South Africa eNCA
