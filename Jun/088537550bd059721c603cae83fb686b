JOHANNESBURG - The National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) will study Eskomâ€™s motion to have its tariffs reviewed. The power utility turned to the courts to ask that Nersa review its five percent tariff increase. Eskom initially applied for a 19,9 percent hike. The cash-strapped power utility is feeling the pressure with employees set to picket outside its offices on Thursday.
