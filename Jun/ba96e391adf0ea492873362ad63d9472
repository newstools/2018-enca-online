JOHANNESBURG – A play once banned by Robert Mugabe, has been performed for the first time in Zimbabwe. In 2012, the Mugabe regime stopped the play, called 1983: The Dark Years. It deals with a series of massacres the Zimbabwe National Army carried out against Ndebele civilians in the 1980s.

In one scene, a mother is forced to burn her baby alive. “In most scenes like the rape scenes and other sensitive scenes, people were actually laughing, I was not because I am more closer to the issue, I really know how it has broken people down and people need to actually forgive at least, we need for people to open up and speak out,” said Linda Mpofu, who watched the play. “I am so emotional about this issue because we lost our loved ones during that time. I was young by then, we could not sleep at home sometimes,” said another audience member, Sipesa Moyo. eNCA
