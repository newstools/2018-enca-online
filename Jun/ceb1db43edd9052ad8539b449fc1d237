JOHANNESBURG - The commission of Inquiry into tax administration and governance issues at South African Revenue Service (SARS) started its public hearings on Tuesday. The commission has been tasked to investigate reports of mismanagement that have dented SARS’ reputation. Retired Judge Robert Nugent, who heads the inquiry, says it will focus on governance and is urgent. Nugent says it's important to understand why there was an R50-billion shortfall in revenue collection. Among the first people to testify was Minister of Public Enterprise and former SARS Commissioner Pravin Gordhan. Gordhan said on Tuesday the institution did not tolerate corruption during his tenure. He is dismissed claims that the institution was in already in a mess when Tom Moyane was appointed its head in 2014.
