Harry and Meghan have already announced that they will visit Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand later this year for their first overseas tour as a married couple. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who were married at Windsor Castle last month, have timed their trip to coincide with the Invictus Games in Sydney in October. Harry, the second son of heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles, set up the global sports championship for wounded personnel after a decade in the army. All four countries on the tour are members of the Commonwealth, the 53-nation grouping for which Harry is a youth ambassador. AFP
