BEIJING - Chinese banks and insurers have lent stronger support to the country's real economy, while effectively preventing and controlling financial risks since the beginning of this year, China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) said on Thursday. According to the latest statistics of the commission, by the end of May balance of domestic and foreign currencies loans of the banking sector reached $20.5-trillion (R226.8-trillion), up 12 percent year on year. The insurance sector provided the real economy with $480-trillion for security.

In particular, we encourage them to allocate more limited credit loan resources to manufacturing industry, emerging strategic industry, infrastructure and areas of national economic development with wink links," said the commission's head of the Prudential Regulation Authority Xiao Yuanqi. This year the CBIRC will continue to devote greater efforts in preventing and controlling financial risks and guide the banks and insurers to operate in line with the regulations. It also aims to push for an orderly exit of those "zombie enterprises" from the market while providing funds to those promising ones to help them overcome the difficulties lied ahead of them.

All sectors, no matter if it's capital adequacy ratio, solvency or liquidity, remain stable. Some external risks had imposed very little impact on our financial system and market. These factors will neither interrupt our existing deployments in preventing risks and managing market disorders nor shake our determination of further promoting reform and opening up," said Xiao.
