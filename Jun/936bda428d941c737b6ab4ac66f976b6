BLOEMFONTEIN – England defence coach Paul Gustard on Monday announced that Worcester Warriors hooker Jack Singleton will join the Red Rose squad in South Africa. England emerged relatively injury-free from the Ellis Park Test although they have decided to bolster their hooker options. “Just Luke Cowan-Dickie really, he’s got a tight hamstring so Jack Singleton is coming over as a precaution. We’ve only got two hookers in the camp so we need to be careful,"  said Gustard. “He’s progressing well, we’ll have to just see and assess it.” Schalk Brits out of retirement to join South Africa squad as England call-up Jack Singleton as injury cover ahead of second Test
