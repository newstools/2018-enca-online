The Hawks and SANParks say their latest rhino poaching bust is significant.

In this specific incident, we have looked at the smuggling of rhino horn from the parks into the greater areas of Gauteng of which we addressed these two suspects who were arrested and currently is on the court roll. "It's significant that we are targeting market-related places within SA and we've already established a great footprint within our South East Asian countries in terms of cooperation and coordination of investigations that it is syndicate related," said Colonel Johan Jooste, who leads the SANPark anti-poaching unit. Col Jooste from the #Hawks: The ppl involved are those who acquire rhino horn from the parks and then facilitate movement of the horn to South East Asia. We have disrupted the supply chain. #RhinoPoaching #HawksArrest Col Jooste regarding why the two suspects got bail: Those merits are before the court and they're dealt with individually. Some will get bail, others not. #RhinoPoaching #HawksArrest Col Jooste: If you address organised crime, each one is as NB as the next. We will see the ripple effect afterwards irrespective of how many arrests. #RhinoPoaching #HawksArrest Col Jooste on bail conditions: Each of the suspects were given bail of R50 000. They have to report daily to a local police station. They cannot leave the region without informing the investigating officer. They surrendered their passports. #RhinoPoaching #HawksArrest eNCA
