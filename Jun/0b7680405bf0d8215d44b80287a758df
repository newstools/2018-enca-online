Police spokesperson Lungelo Dlamini said a group of armed men travelling in three vehicles had started shooting at the cash van and bombed its back door before members of a nearby community policing forum arrived. "The driver continued driving and suddenly, suspects in a Lexus vehicle shot at the tyres and they were forced to stop," Dlamini said. "Five suspects armed with rifles approached them, wearing balaclavas. The suspects bombed the door of the vehicle.  A group of CPF members heard the explosion while sitting at a meeting in the vicinity and responded to the scene. The suspects fled the scene and left the Lexus behind and got into a Polo vehicle without taking any money," said Dlamini.
