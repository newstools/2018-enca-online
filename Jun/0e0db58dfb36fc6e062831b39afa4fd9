JOHANNESBURG – Abahlali base-Mjondolo chairman Sfiso Ngcobo was laid to rest in Ethekwini on Saturday. Ngcobo was gunned down by unknown assailants outside his home on his way to buy a cold drink from a shipping container a few metres from his house. He had received death threats, according to his wife and comrades in the shackdweller movement. The murder of Ngcobo is believed to be politically connected. "Tensions have been escalating in the Marianhill area, which includes Marinridge, for some time," Abahlali said after he was killed. "The hostility towards our movement comes from the leaders of the local ANC, as well as local business interests who depend on the ruling party for tenders," the movement said.
