		South Africa’s Jovan Rebula---- secures a 2&1 victory over England’s Tom Sloman. ---- #TheAmateur pic.twitter.com/zadUc6LEyp The 20-year-old George golfer is the sixth South African to reach the last round. Bobby Cole (1966), David Suddards (1980), Ben Fouche (1988), Trevor Immelman (1997) and Zander Lombard (2004) all got there, but only Cole went the distance. Just 18 at the time, the upstart from Springs stunned the golfing world when he beat Scotsman Ronnie Slade 3 & 2 at Carnoustie. Now Rebula has the chance to put another South African name on the trophy and, if he wins, he’ll also have bragging rights over his famous uncle Ernie Els. The four-time Major champion had three stabs at the title and made it to the final on his third try in 1988…on the bag for Ben Fouche, who lost by one hole to Sweden’s Christian Hardin at Royal Porthcawl. George golfer @JovanRebula mowed down Mitch Waite 6 & 4 for a spot in #TheAmateur final...let's hear from the George golfer, who is the 6th ---- to make the final two.

Rebula avenged his fellow GolfRSA National Squad team-mate with a 2 & 1 win and mowed down Mitch Waite 6 & 4 in the semi-final. “To be honest, I have some mixed emotions, because it feels like everything happened so quickly today, but mainly I’m just really, really happy,” said Rebula, “This is what we all work for; to reach the final of one of the biggest amateur events in the world. I feel like I prepared really well for this week. I struck the ball well all week and I limited the bad shots. Now I’m just really excited for the final.” African News Agency
