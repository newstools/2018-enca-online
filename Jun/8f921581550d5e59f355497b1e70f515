Peter Goss says practicing ethics and good policy's not the responsibility of just one person. An inquiry is currently under way into the revenue service's tax administration and governance. Former senior SARS officials shared their experiences of working for the revenue collector. One of the focus points is to determine whether former staff members were forced to leave. eNCA
