PIETERMARITZBURG – An ongoing feud between long-distance taxi operators erupted into a shootout that left one bystander dead at the Pietermaritzburg taxi rank on Friday. According to police, four people were injured as the Masukwana taxi rank turned into a war zone. A double cab belonging to a security company attached to the taxi rank was torched. The shootout on Friday morning forced commuters, street traders and pupils at the nearby M L Sultan High School to run for cover. "It was during our lunch break, around 10 in the morning, when all of a sudden we heard the exchange of gunfire and ... everyone ran for cover. You can imagine the chaos as kids took cover,"  said one teacher, who did not want to be named. Pupils were allowed to leave school just after midday and had to use a side exit as the main entrance led to the scene of the shooting. A street vendor relived the horror of the shooting, which she described as the scariest moments of her life. "I saw him as he fell down and make his last movements. It is so unfair because that person was just going about his routine when he got shot, there was a smell of gunfire," the shocked vendor said of the person who died. She lamented the fact that the shooting meant vendors did not make any money, but said she was grateful that she had not been harmed.
