Apartheid wage gap still exists at #Eskom and black women are some of the lowest paid at #Eskom. "Our members do not earn that kind of money. This a lie. It is a serious insult to our members who are currently being offered a zero percent increase by Eskom. "[The] Apartheid wage gap still exists at Eskom and black women are some of the lowest paid at Eskom," NUM spokesperson Livhuwani Mammburu said.

Workers unions are currently embroiled in a wage dispute with Eskom as they demand up to 15 percent salary increments while the embattled power utility offers them a zero percent increase.
