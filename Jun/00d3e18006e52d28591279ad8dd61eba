INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION â€“ Two NASA astronauts are venturing out of the International Space Station and will conduct a spacewalk on Thursday. The two will install new high-definition cameras to capture spacecraft docking with the International Space Station, including new American-made spacecraft with scheduled test flights later this year. Spacewalkers @Astro_Ricky and @Astro_Feustel are placed in the crew lock now and are waiting for depressurization and the start of their spacewalk at around 8am ET. #AskNASA https://t.co/yuOTrZ4Jut pic.twitter.com/BMDpmogSB7 NASA says the cameras will help commercial crew vehicles align with the international docking adapter at the forward end of Harmony. eNCA
