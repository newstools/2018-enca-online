INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION â€“ Two NASA astronauts are venturing out of the International Space Station and will conduct a spacewalk on Thursday. The two will install new high-definition cameras to capture spacecraft docking with the International Space Station, including new American-made spacecraft with scheduled test flights later this year. NASA says the cameras will help commercial crew vehicles align with the international docking adapter at the forward end of Harmony. eNCA
