DUNEDIN, New Zealand - Winger Rieko Ioane scored three tries while Damian McKenzie crossed twice in a full display of his attacking abilities as the All Blacks completed a 49-14 victory over France in Dunedin on Saturday that gave them a 3-0 series sweep. McKenzie's second try early in the second half gave the world champions a 28-14 lead and the breathing space they needed after the French had played the All Blacks at their own high tempo game for the first 45 minutes. Fullback Ben Smith and replacement flanker Matt Todd also crossed for the All Blacks who were far more ruthless in the second half where they scored 28 unanswered points. France scrumhalf Baptiste Serin, who replaced captain Morgan Parra early in the match, and the returning Wesley Fofana scored tries for the visitors, who were again impressive but over-ran by a relentless black wave in the final 30 minutes.
