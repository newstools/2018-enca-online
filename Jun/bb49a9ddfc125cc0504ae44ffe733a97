JOHANNESBURG - If you're a dog lover, then the 'What the Fluff' challenge is perfect for you and your pooch. Dog owners are playing tricks with their furry friends, only to intrigue, concern and confuse them. In several videos posted on YouTube and Facebook, challengers raise and lower a blanket in front of their dogs face. This is done several timesÂ until the owner suddenly disappears - and ducks behind a door. To the humour of many, the dogs are a little slow in figuring out where their owners have disappeared to, and their reactions are priceless. eNCA
