JOHANNESBURG – Eskom has lifted load-shedding after several areas across the country were without power. Earlier on Thursday, Eskom evening implemented Stage 1 load-shedding. It said it might take some municipalities time for power to be fully restored. The load shedding commenced at 17:41 pm. WATCH: Eskom presents plans to avoid load-shedding Earlier, Eskom reported that power supply will be constrained amid a strike by its employees. It said this was “due to the acts of sabotage and intimidation” by striking workers, who are demanding a 15 percent salary increase across the board in a one-year agreement. Eskom, however, said that it's not going to increase salaries at all this year. Load-shedding schedules are available on the Eskom website. eNCA
