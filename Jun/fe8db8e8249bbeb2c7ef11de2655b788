JOHANNESBURG – It would appear that former president Jacob Zuma’s charm was not enough to lure voters after the African National Congress (ANC) failed to snatch Nkandla's ward 7 from the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) in by-elections. The IFP on Wednesday retained the ward it won in the 2016 local polls with an increased margin of 53.33-percent of vote. In 2016, it had received 51.26-percent of the vote. Zuma was reportedly warmly received by ward seven candidates as he canvassed for the ANC on Tuesday. He told voters to vote ANC to ensure proper development and service delivery in the area.

The ward became vacant after the death of IFP councillor Mphumzeni Mthombeni. The Economic Freedom Fighters and the National Freedom Front also contested the polls. In another by-election on the same day at Ethekwini's ward 10, Terence Peter Collins of the Democratic Alliance (DA) won the by-election and retained his party’s seat won in the 2016 local polls.
