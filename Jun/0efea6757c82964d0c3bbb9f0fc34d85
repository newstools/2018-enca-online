JOHANNESBURG – Talks between unions and Eskom have failed to break a wage hike deadlock. The cash-strapped power utility is struggling to keep the lights on after workers went on strike over wages last week. Workers on Wednesday rejected a 4,7 percent wage hike offer and instead tabled an alternative request of nine percent. Talks on Thursday concluded with no deal being reached. Eskom ‘top heavy’ The National Union of Mineworkers of South Africa (Numsa) said a top heavy leadership was costing Eskom. He said the parastatal needs to trim the number of executives. "We've become expert in these negotiations, the argument that workers are expensive is false... In 2011, Eskom had 80 top executives and to date, it has 600 and they are expensive. That's where the cut must place,” Numsa’s Irvin Jim said. eNCA
