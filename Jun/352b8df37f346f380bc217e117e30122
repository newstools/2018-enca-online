BRUSSELS - The European Commission labelled as "unacceptable" on Wednesday the United States' conclusion that Spanish olives should face import duties because they are being sold far too cheaply and benefit from unfair subsidies.

"The decision by the United States Department of Commerce to impose unreasonably high and prohibitive duties anti-subsidy and anti-dumping duties on Spanish olives is simply unacceptable," a Commission spokesman said. "This is a protectionist measure targeting a high-quality and successful EU product popular with US consumers," he continued.

The US International Trade Commission (ITC) will make a final determination on July 24 on the Spanish olive imports that were worth $67.6 million in 2017. The European Commission would consider possible further action after this. The Spanish government said it regretted the latest US move and would take up the matter with Brussels. Reuters
