JOHANNESBURG – Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene has answered questions on issues facing South Africa at the World Economic Forum. He says the economy needs to grow much faster to address poverty and inequality. READ: Good governance at SOEs crucial for economic growth: Nene “The biggest challenge is growth -- the economy hasn’t grown adequately enough to be able to address our challenges… even when our economy did grow a few years ago, it was not enough to create enough employment opportunities. As a result, we have seen unemployment remaining stubbornly high.” “Unless we are able to address the area of economic growth and development that is also inclusive, we will not have addressed our challenges. You can talk about the issues of the size of our debt issues that we have with the SOEs [State Owned Enterprises] which are huge risk as we speak that’s a certain area that we are focusing on, but at the end of the day you need an economy that grows in a sustainable manner inclusive enough that it address our challenges,” he said. eNCA
