JOHANNESBURG - Attorneys have reportedly recommended that criminal charges be laid against Brian Molefe and three men with close ties to the Guptas.
	According to Sunday newspapers City Press and the Sunday Times, the allegations relate to a controversial locomotives tender at Transnet. The report, by MNS Attorneys, also reportedly recommends that the parastatal recoup money lost from Molefe, after he allegedly misled the board. Transnet allegedly lost R19-billion after Molefe inflated the cost of a tender for locomotives from about R39-billion to R54-billion. He was the group's CEO at the time, before moving to Eskom.
