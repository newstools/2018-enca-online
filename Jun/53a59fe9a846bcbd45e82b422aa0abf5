SARANSK - Japan beat 10-man Colombia 2-1 in their opening Group H match on Tuesday, the first time an Asian team has overcome a South American one at the World Cup. Colombia midfielder Carlos Sanchez was sent off in the third minute for deliberate handball - the second fastest red card in World Cup history. Shinji Kagawa scored the resulting penalty to put Japan 1-0 up in the sixth minute, but Juan Quintero equalised with a low free kick which squeezed over the line shortly before halftime.

Colombia attacking midfielder James Rodriguez, who was left out of the starting line-up due to muscle pain, replaced Quintero in the 59th minute but failed to change the course of the match. Reuters
