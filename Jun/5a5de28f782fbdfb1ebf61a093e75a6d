PARLIAMENT - Newly-elected North West Premier Job Mokgoro says it's too soon for him to give a diagnosis on problems facing his province. He was answering questions in Parliament following his election last week after months of turmoil in the province. National government has effectively taken over control of the key departments in the province, including health and education.

"At the risk of over simplification we are grappling with complex issues. I would be the last one to understand what the root causes are because the danger is if I say to this house I understand what the causes are, we will all agree that these are the interventions. And when we come back having observed the implementations of these interventions I would feel like one of the most idiotic persons in this world because those interventions would have not worked," he said.
