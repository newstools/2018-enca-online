RUNCORN, England - Britain's Queen Elizabeth and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, arrived in the English county of Cheshire on Thursday to begin their first official joint royal trip without Prince Harry. Elizabeth and Meghan, who married the monarch's grandson in a glittering ceremony at her Windsor Castle home last month, travelled by the Royal Train to northwest England for a day of events. While millions around the world watched the pomp and pageantry of her wedding, Thursday's visit will be more typical of the engagements that the former American actress, a star of the TV drama "Suits", will carry out as a working member of the British royal family.
