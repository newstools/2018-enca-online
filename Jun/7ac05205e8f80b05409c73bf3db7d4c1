I am not the president but I can't help but this must not be misread as if I am now arguing to remain a minister forever. And I am not prejudging anyone with what I am going to say. This endless reshuffling had devastating negative impacts on departments," he said. "You the reason why there are vacancies of DG [Director General] and five DDGs [Deputy Director Generals] largely has to do that. The last two ministers were in the middle of the process and then they were gone so new ones come in and now Nzimande has to come in. I hope that we will finalize that sooner than later,"  he said. The minister said he was not challenging any presidential prerogative.

There may be good reason for reshuffling but I can see the negative impact that this has had. I think as part of the new dawn we can concede those things," said Nzimande. Nzimande was axed as a minister by former president Jacob Zuma and has been brought back as transport minister by President Cyril Ramaphosa. eNCA
