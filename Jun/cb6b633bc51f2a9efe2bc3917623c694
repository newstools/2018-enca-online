JOHANNESBURG - South Africa’s rand was softer early on Wednesday after weaker-than-expected first quarter GDP figures in the previous session. Sluggish emerging markets also weighed on the local unit. At 07:02, the rand was 12.7750 to the dollar, a slight recovery from the previous session’s highs of 12.8300. Statistics South Africa on Tuesday revealed the economy shrank by 2.2 percent in the first quarter of 2018.

We are expecting a pull back to the 12.50 area in the next couple of days. If the pull back in the Euro gets postponed, the rand pull back gets delayed,” Mehut Daya, technical analyst at Nedbank.
