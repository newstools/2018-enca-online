POLOKWANE - Madagascar beat South Africa 4-3 on penalties in their Cosafa Cup quarterfinal at New Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane on Sunday. It is the first time Madagascar have beaten Bafana Bafana, and South Africans are not impressed. In the words of a former minister "you bunch of loses!" We lost to Madagascar?????? #BafanaBafana I say fire Danny Jordaan. @robertmarawa pic.twitter.com/1EASCmgRk3 Bafana Bafana has just lost to some barely distinguishable backwater called Madagascar. These folks had fantasies of going to the World Cup in Russia. pic.twitter.com/oXtulP8A87 Follow everyone who Likes or Retweets this --
		
		Bafana Sucks though Bafana Bafana just lost to Madagascar.
		
		Name one football player from Madagascar. GO!!!
		
		Thought as much. Balance me quick quick. Bafana awaits their opponent in the quarter finals while their opponent play 2-3 games to get to the quarter finals. And Bafana still lose -- you would think with the amount of european based players and expirienced players we would easily win. #Bafana It was a young #Bafana team today, with next to no international experience, but you’ve still got to be expecting to beat Madagascar. It’s not good enough. Springboks: Let's be the joke of the weekend
