JOHANNESBURG – A shortage of officers at South African Police Service (SAPS) stations is nationwide, Police Minister Bheki Cele revealed on Friday. He was responding to community queries in Chatsworth about high crime levels in the area. Cele says delays in post-mortems are not a police issue, but a @HealthZA one. #ChatsworthCrime pic.twitter.com/yuz3HjlZbR Chatsworth police station in KwaZulu-Natal is short of 16 officers and 12 vehicles, Cele said. Just a few weeks ago, a nine-year-old girl was shot and killed in a botched hijacking in Shallcross, which sparked anger and anti-crime protests by the community. Cele did not promise to solve the issue of staff shortages anytime soon.

Cele urged locals to report corrupt officers. “If there are members of the SAPS who are rotten, bring them to us... We want this to be an organisation of excellence.” eNCA
