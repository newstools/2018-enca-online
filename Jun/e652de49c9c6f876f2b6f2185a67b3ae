JOHANNESBURG – There's been an explosion at Zimbabwean President, Emmerson Mnangagwa's election rally at the White City Stadium, Bulawayo. Several people have been injured. This afternoon, as we were leaving a wonderful rally in Bulawayo, there was an explosion on the stage. Several people were affected by the blast, and I have already been to visit them in the hospital. Mnangagwa is safe and was taken to the state house. Vice presidents Constantino Chiwenga and Kembo Mohadi and a minister sustained minor injuries following the blast. "There has been an incident at Bulawayo where the president was addressing a rally. This is now a police issue but the president is safe at Bulawayo State House," spokesman George Charamba told Reuters. While we await further information, my thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by this senseless act of violence. The campaign has been conducted in a free and peaceful environment, and we will not allow this cowardly act to get in our way as we move towards elections. "We are still to get information on what exactly happened as we understand that some people could have been injured as this happened in the VIP tent." National Police spokeswoman Charity Charamba said she did not have details on the incident. Let us continue to be united and address our differences peacefully. The strongest response to violence is peace. The strongest response to hate is love. God Bless Zimbabwe Several security personnel were also injured, the state-owned Herald newspaper said.
