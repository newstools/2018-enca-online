JOHANNESBURG – Girls in Kenya who get pregnant in school will not benefit from free medical cover, National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) chief executive Geoffrey Mwangi has warned.

Those who want to be assisted may opt to look for other sources of funding or register with the ‘Linda Mama’ initiative,” Mwangi said. The Linda Mama initiative is an expanded free maternal care programme for expectant mothers. The secondary school medical cover recently rolled out by the government is only designed to take care of in-patient and outpatient illnesses.
