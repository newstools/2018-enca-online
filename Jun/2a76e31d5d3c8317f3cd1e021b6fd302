JOHANNESBURG - Leather design and products manufacturing company, Leratolethato's head designer and director, Nthabi Lephoko said she was aimed at establishing a legacy and adding sustainable value onto the local creative industry. Lephoko said Leratolethato was established in 2011 following the successful outcomes of a feasibility study that she conducted on skins and hides on behalf of the department of trade and industry. “I derived a lot of inspiration based on recommendations of my study and was inspired by the opportunities in this sector and have never looked back since. I was able to establish my company which currently employs six people and I am definitely looking forward to expanding operations,” Lephoko said. “My company produces a wide variety of products ranging from card holders, wallets, leather belts, handbags and I also do the furniture range where I manufacture cushions, chairs and couches and a little bit of clothing.” Lephoko said that she would like to expand and that she already had a business plan in place to do so. “I am looking at establishing an incubator which will focus on leather manufacturing and that I can share my skills with other people. Part of the reasons I would like to expand and eventually establish an incubator is to get the kind of support I need and the kind of quality control that would enable me to meet standards internationally,” said Lephoko.
