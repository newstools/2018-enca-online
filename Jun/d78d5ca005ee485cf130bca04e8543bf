JOHANNESBURG - Motorists are in for a massive 82c-a-litre increase in the price of petrol on Tuesday. This is for both 93- and 95-octane petrol. Diesel will also increase even further by between 85 and 87 cents a litre, depending on the grade. This comes on the back of increases in May that took fuel prices to record highs.

Energy Minister Jeff Radebe announces the adjustments on Friday afternoon, saying they were the result of a depreciation in the rand against the dollar and an increase in the price of crude oil. The international price of petroleum products also contributed. The Department of Energy said it urged motorists to save fuel by using lift clubs and public transport whenever possible, and planning trips beforehand. eNCA
