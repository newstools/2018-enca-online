Baxter selected youth for the Cosafa Cup to give players international exposure with the African Nations Cup qualifiers that resume in September in mind. The team lost on penalties to Madagascar in the quarterfinal after a 0-0 draw but recorded emphatic victories over Namibia (4-1) and Botswana (3-0).
