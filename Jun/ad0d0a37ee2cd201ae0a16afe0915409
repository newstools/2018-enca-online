JOHANNESBURG - Senegal head coach Aliou Cisse and Colombia head coach Jose Pekerman won't be needing to write inspiring pre-match team talks for their final World Cup qualifying match on Thursday. Senegal need only a draw and a point from the match to make it through to the round of 16 knockout stages. Colombia is coming off an electric performance in a 3-0 victory over Poland that kept their knockout round qualification hopes alive after they lost to Japan 2-1 in their opening match, while Senegal drew 2-2 with the Samurai Blue after beating the Poles 2-1 at the start of their campaign.

Senegal's only World Cup finals match against a side from the South American continent was a 3-3 group stage draw with Uruguay at Korea/Japan in 2002.
