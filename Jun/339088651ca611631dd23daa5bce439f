She says the second scenario is as a more positive scenario where the country really looks at the gravity of what has happened of the past few years in a particular and has a turnaround moment with civil society and the state investing in education in particular. The third scenario is one is one where the energy spent on restoring the integrity of the state fails. "What we saw was corruption, patriarchy, ineffective governance, and risk management in both the public and private sector is running much deeper than any of us believed and it plays out what the consequences of that would be," says Vale. Research initiative Indlulamithi South African Scenarios 2030 involves conversations between government, the corporate sector and civil society about the country's political and economic future.
