This unprecedented growth is part of Fifa’s overall strategy to reach out and engage with more fans in more countries around the world. It is also the result of a number of digital initiatives introduced before Russia 2018 to ensure fans are more connected and more engaged than ever before with action both on and off the pitch. Thirty-two dedicated team reporters, close to the action and covering the tournament in-depth, are followed across 16 languages on Twitter and have engaged 200 000 fans in Facebook groups, with Argentina and Brazil the top two nations in that respect. Throughout Russia 2018, Fifa has also supported fans with a dedicated community management service on its social media platforms and helped with more than 100 000 questions being answered so far. New innovative ways of storytelling, such as visual stories and a match report service in International Sign Language, have also helped enhance accessibility to match content. African News Agency
