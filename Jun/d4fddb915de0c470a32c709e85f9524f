SINGAPORE - The main course may be hard-to-swallow denuclearisation, but Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un also had a heady mix of Yangzhou fried rice and a dark-chocolate tartlet ganache on their plates on Tuesday. According to a menu card published from the White House, Kim and Trump had a plethora of western, Korean, Chinese and Malay dishes to choose from at the swanky Capella hotel in Singapore. To start there was prawn cocktail with avocado salad, a Malay "green mango kerabu with honey-lime dressing and fresh octopus" and "oiseon", a Korean stuffed cucumber dish.

Trump is a notoriously picky and unadventurous eater, enjoying Big Macs and steak (well done, with ketchup). Temer ia curtir o menu do almo√ßo do #TrumpKimsummit.

Or, in a nod to China's substantial influence over the talks, he and Kim could have picked the "combination of sweet-and-sour crispy pork and Yangzhou fried rice with homemade XO chili sauce". In case Kim is similarly picky, he could turn to the familiar comfort of "Daegu jorim", a soy-braised cod fish with radish and Asian vegetables. It is unclear whether the unlikely pair came together at the end over Haagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream with cherry coulis -- or whether Trump, as he has done before, gave himself two scoops when everyone else got one.
