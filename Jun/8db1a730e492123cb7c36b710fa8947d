The search party started digging and discovered an unidentified body in a shallow grave. “The members on the crime scene did a preliminary interview with a male member of that household,” Western Cape police said in a statement. “As the police was evacuating with this male, the crowd became rowdy and threw stones and bricks at the police. They charged at the members in an attempt to get hold of this male. “While the police tried to get the alleged suspect away from the crime scene the house was petrol bombed and set alight. “The suspect had to be removed from the scene in a Nyala for his safety. The police had to use stun grenades, handgas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd.” READ: Police strategy to reduce violent crime could work: study The police said two members of its members sustained head and leg injuries as a result of the stone throwing.
