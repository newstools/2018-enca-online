PARIS - Following their 22-20 defeat to Wales in Washington DC on Saturday, South Africa have dropped to an all-time low at seventh in the World Rugby Rankings. The victory for the Welsh was their third consecutive win over the Springboks and was worth 1.05 rating points - enough to lift them above the Springboks and Scotland into fifth place, their highest ranking since February last year. South Africa, who fielded seven debutants in an experimental starting line-up, dropped one spot from last week's position of sixth.

However, replacement Robert du Preez gifted Wales the win when his clearance kick was charged down and the ball fell kindly to Elias. Wales now travel to Argentina for two tests against Los Pumas, on June 9 and 16, while South Africa face England at home in a three-test series. The only other match to count towards the rankings over the last seven days came in the Asia Rugby Championship where Hong Kong beat Korea 39-5 to claim their maiden title.
