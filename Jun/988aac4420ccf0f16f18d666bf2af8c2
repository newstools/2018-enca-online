JOHANNESBURG – The Department of Arts and Culture has welcomed the North Gauteng High Court ruling in favour of Miriam Makeba’s grandchildren and her foundation in acting as the proprietors of the intellectual property rights of the late singer. In October last year, Siyandisa Music filed an application to interdict Makeba’s grandchildren Lumumba and Zenzile Lee from acting as the proprietors of the intellectual property rights without approval. "The matter has highlighted once more the contentious issue of ownership of royalties,” Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa said.

Cabinet recently approved a policy to guide legal reform on intellectual property. Marumo Nkomo from  DTI spoke to Siki Mgabadeli. eNCA
