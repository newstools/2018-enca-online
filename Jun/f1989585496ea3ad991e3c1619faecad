BOKSBURG - Mineworkers should refuse to work in dangerous conditions, President Cyril Ramaphosa told members of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) on Friday. Ramaphosa delivered the keynote address at the NUM's congress. He said he is concerned about the increasing number of deaths in the mining industry. Fights about credentials delayed the opening of the congress, which will elect new leaders.

David Sipunzi also said the union must work hard to try and win back members it lost in Rustenburg. Ramaphosa said union leaders should always put their members first. "The vision and the mission is to organise all mineworkers and to promote the interest of members and turn their dreams into reality. The vision and mission of this union is not to promote certain individuals and serve their interests…The vision has never revolved around serving the interests of individuals... Mineworkers come first, the leaders come last," the president told delegates. eNCA
