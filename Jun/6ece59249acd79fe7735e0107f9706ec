JOHANNESBURG – American law firm Bernstein Liebhard has filed a class action lawsuit against Sibanye-Stillwater. The legal action was ordered by some of the gold producer's shareholders. They want to recover losses suffered due to a sharp fall in Sibanye-Stillwater's share price. LOOK BACK: Fatal accidents at Sibanye mines this year The shareholders say the financial losses were triggered by the spate of deaths at the gold miner's operations. Sibanye-Stillwater's seen 21 fatalities at its operations so far this year. That’s nearly half of the total number of fatalities recorded in the country’s mining industry. Bernstein Liebhard said the suit deals with what it calls misleading statements made by the company. eNCA
