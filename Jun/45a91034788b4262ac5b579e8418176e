"This loss of self-control can be attributed to the fatigue of an elderly priest, but that doesn't excuse it," the diocese of Meaux, which includes the town, said in a statement.

"The child was bawling and I needed to turn his head so I could pour the water. I was saying 'be quiet' but he wouldn't calm down," the priest told France Info radio on Friday. "It was something between a caress and a little slap," he said. "I was trying to calm him down, I didn't really know what to do." AFP
