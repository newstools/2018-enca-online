DURBAN - The Senzo Meyiwa Foundation will host an anti-crime walk in uMlazi, outside Durban, on Saturday. The walk is aimed at creating dialogue about violence against women and children. Senzo Meyiwa was a soccer player and Bafana Bafana captain who was shot and killed in 2014. No arrests have been made yet for his murder. "The walk takes us through the township of uMlazi, where Senzo is from, right through to the police station where we will be handing them a memorandum asking them to please speed up (solutions) such as (to) crime in our community and society. We are opening up dialogue for us to be assisted", said Zukiswa Vutela, Senzo Meyiwa Foundation. "Regarding Senzo Meyiwa, we've also invited other players who are current PSL players and old PSL players to be part of a game that's going to take place on 9 June at King Zwelithini Stadium which is the first commemoration game for Senzo Meyiwa. "You will also remember that his tombstone unveiling has still not happened. So the family sees this as maybe a healing process for the family, because yes they haven’t found closure, but they're saying they still want to celebrate their son. They still want to celebrate this icon and legend of South Africa." eNCA
