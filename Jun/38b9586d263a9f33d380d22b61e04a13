NEW YORK - Addiction to video games has been recognised by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a mental health disorder.
	
	The organisation's International Classification of Diseases describes addiction to digital and video games as taking precedence over other life interests. But the lobby group, Video Games Coalition, has asked the WHO to reconsider its decision. The group says the games have an educational, therapeutic, and recreational value that's widely recognised. The WHO’s department of mental health and substance abuse says it's an emerging social issue. "Definitely it is a societal problem. And the very fact that we did not put gaming disorder earlier in the classification means that it's an emerging problem and certainly it's more common in those countries and regions where gaming is readily accessible," said the WHOs Shekhar Saxena. "In subcultures where a lot of people are doing gaming together, certainly external environment is extremely important here. "We still have to do a lot of monitoring to see which games are more addictive, which regions are more at risk and indeed which populations are more at risk." eNCA
