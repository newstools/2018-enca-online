SAMARA - Australia captain Mile Jedinak hammered in a 38th-minute penalty for handball awarded by the VAR to draw the Socceroos level at 1-1 with Denmark during the World Cup Group C match in Samara on Thursday. Jedinak's goal cancelled out Christian Eriksen's early score, the Danish playmaker firing home from the edge of the area in the seventh minute after latching on to a ball from Nicolai Jorgensen. Both teams' hopes of advancing will be settled in the final round of Group C matches, when Australia take on Peru and Denmark meet France. In a tense second half, each side had chances and Denmark could thank their goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel for two fine saves from shots by Daniel Arzani and Mathew Leckie in the dying minutes. Reuters
