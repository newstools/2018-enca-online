JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa is optimistic the African National Congress (ANC) and its tripartite alliance partners are one step closer to addressing their differences. He says division can’t be fixed overnight and it is a process that will ultimately lead to a united tripartite alliance. Ramaphosa has been holding talks with the South African Communist Party (SACP) and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) in Johannesburg on Saturday. The SACP says Ramaphosa appears to be committed to addressing the alliance’s concerns. According to Blade Nzimande, SACP general secretary: "We must judge him by what he does together with the ANC leadership."
