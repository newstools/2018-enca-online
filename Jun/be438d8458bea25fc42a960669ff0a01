JOHANNESBURG â€“ The Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities (CRL) Commission has called on the KwaZulu-Natal Education Department to act against discrimination levelled at pupils who belong to the Shembe church. The body intervened after a number of school pupils from the Shembe church were forced to have their hair cut. It is believed that in some schools, police also got involved in forcing pupils to cut their hair. READ: Black girls' hair a national debate Parents of the pupils laid complaints with the CRL.
