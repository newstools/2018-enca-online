The 28-year-old, who won the second of her two Wimbledon titles in 2014, hasn't been past the third round in her last three appearances at the Grand Slam. Kvitova has now claimed five WTA titles this season, as well as winning a women's tour-leading 37 matches over the last six months. @Petra_Kvitova is an incredible example of hard work and personal growth. Congratulations Petra, you’re an amazing role model ----❤️-- pic.twitter.com/sHNt7ITugr "It's amazing to defend a title. It's not happened in a long time for me," the big-serving Kvitova said. "I was too nervous and Magda put pressure on me in the first set. "It was tough to fight back but I was relaxed and it paid off afterwards." .@Petra_Kvitova is all smiles on the practice courts ahead of the #NatureValleyClassic final! pic.twitter.com/vo7g8jXyne World number eight Kvitova, finally close to her best after the horrific knife attack that halted her career in 2016, will kick off her Wimbledon campaign when the tournament gets underway on July 2.
