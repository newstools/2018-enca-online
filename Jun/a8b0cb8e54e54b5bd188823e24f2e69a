JOHANNESBURG - Three police officers are to appear in the Krugersdorp Magistrate's Court on Monday after they allegedly hijacked and abducted a truck driver and his escort in Krugersdorp West on Saturday. Gauteng police spokesman Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said the officers from the Germiston Flying Squad allegedly stopped a truck and its escort vehicle on the Rustenburg road, forcing the driver of the escort vehicle into a police vehicle. One of the police officers jumped into the truck and forced the driver to move to the passenger seat, Dlamini said. "The victims were driven into an open veld and forced to lie on the ground [at gunpoint]. They were robbed of a substantial amount of money before the officers drove away."
