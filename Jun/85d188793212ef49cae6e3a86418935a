Workers went on strike, resulting in the implementation of load-shedding on Thursday and across the weekend.

The unions are demanding wage increases of between nine and 15 percent and an additional housing allowance. LOAD-SHEDDING: Schedules, info, and how it affects you "There is going to be a wage increase as per the minister's determination. The board will have to raid our coffers. There is going to be some kind of money coming through. As to where it will come through it's a matter that the minister or the board will make a pronouncement. "Our shareholder, which is government, has said that 'do something to improve the situation and improve the offer'. Clearly, it means there's willingness on the part of government to assist us where possible,” said Eskom spokesperson, Khulu Phasiwe. eNCA
