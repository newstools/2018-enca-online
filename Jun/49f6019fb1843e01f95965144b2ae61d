JOHANNESBURG - Youth Day is to be marked with a debate at the Apartheid Museum in Johannesburg on Saturday afternoon that aims to find out where the student leaders of 1976 are now. Moderated by Nolwazi Tusini, the debate will look at the decolonisation narrative, and whether there is still urgency among student leaders today. Hello lovelies--
		This awesome Youth Day event is happening later today at the Apartheid museum. Iâ€™m sure the debate will be exciting, all the panelists are fire and the conversation is important. I really hope to see you there. Doors open at 14:30-- pic.twitter.com/OtU6BEwTWr eNCA
