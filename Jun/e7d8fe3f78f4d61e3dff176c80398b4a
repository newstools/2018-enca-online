JOHANNESBURG – Ashwin Willemse's lawyer says Advocate Vincent Maleka's report into the SuperSport studio walkout is misguided. Nqobizitha Mlilo told eNCA Willemse had been complaining about his treatment at the station since 2016. WATCH: No racism in Willemse walkout incident, says SuperSport The rugby analyst is heading to the Equality Court after an inquiry cleared co-presenters Naas Botha and Nick Mallett of racism. "We're not at a stage where we're inconsequence to the report that Maleka produced. We now see the emails dating back from 2016 relating to issues that Ashwin has been complaining about. Ashwin wants all those emails sent to SuperSport and wants response from Supersport," said Mlilo. eNCA
