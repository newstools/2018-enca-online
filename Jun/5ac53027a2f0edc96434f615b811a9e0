LAGOS - Nigerian police on Wednesday said they were investigating a man for running an illegal blood bank after a teenager needed hospital treatment for giving four pints of blood in a week. Achegbulu Paul was taken into police custody after paying a 17-year-old boy 4,000 naira ($22, 19 euros) to draw blood in an unauthorised facility, said Lagos police spokesman Chike Oti.

"On Monday last week he took two pints of blood from the boy, paid him 4,000 naira. This lad went back for business. "The man took another two pints from him on Saturday 9th June. After taking the two pints of blood from him the boy collapsed." The man was running a clinic out of his Lagos apartment that was "not authorised", said Oti, adding "it is not a laboratory or hygienic enough for such an enterprise".
