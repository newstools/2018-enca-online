JOHANNESBURG - Parliament has called for "strong action" against Sibanye-Stilwater following the death of yet another mine worker. The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Mineral Resources, Sahlulele Luzipo, on Wednesday afternoon said the company should be placed under curatorship and, if need be, lose its operating licence. Luzipo said the rate at which workers are dying at Sibanye-Stillwater mines has reached disastrous proportions. Sibanye said on Tuesday the worker died at its Khomanani mine at the Driefontein operation, west of Johannesburg after he entered a scraper path and was caught by the scraper. "This is another sad incident and all efforts are being focussed on addressing this perplexing increase in safety incidents," the company said.

The company's operations are now responsible for 21 of 45 mine fatalities in 10 incidents since February this year. Sibanye said it would on Friday convene a safety summit in order to collectively address these incidents, prevent the loss of lives at its operations and re-establish its safety record.
