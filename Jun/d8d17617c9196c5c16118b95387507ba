CAPE TOWN - The case dealing with the care arrangements and curatorship of Marli van Breda, the only triple family axe murder survivor, was postponed to July. Her brother Henri was last week slapped with three life sentences plus 16 years for murdering his parents and brother as well as attempting to kill Marli. Shortly after the 2015 attack at the family’s luxury Stellenbosch home, a curator was appointed to assist her with any legal proceedings or major decisions. WATCH: Triple life plus 16 years for axe murderer Henri van Breda Marli suffers from retrograde amnesia and cannot remember details of the attack. The role of her curator was renewed in October 2016, despite the fact that she is no longer a minor. Henri’s application for leave to appeal his murder convictions and sentence will be heard later in June. eNCA
