ALGHERO, Italy - Belgium's Thierry Neuville threw caution to the wind as he won the last six stages of the Rally of Italy on Sunday to overturn a 6.8-second deficit and edge Frenchman Sebastian Ogier. The super champion Thierry Neuville pic.twitter.com/0KRHV6dfMX Neuville, driving a Hyundai, was still 0.7 seconds behind Ogier (M-Sport Ford) entering the closing 6.96km Powerstage but gained 1.4 seconds to finish the race 0.8 seconds ahead. "I really gave it all this weekend," said Neuville, who recorded an overall time of 3hr 29min 18.7sec as he increased his lead at the top of the World Rally standings to 27 points over Ogier. Ott Tanak (Toyota), who finished eighth, remains third overall but is now 70 points back. Work Hard, be brave, fight, win.

"There are rallies in which Thierry will be at a disadvantage." The Frenchman's second place was almost put in danger following a strange incident at the end of the penultimate stage when Ogier drove off without his copilot collecting his time card. It was delivered to him by former team-mate Tanak. After #JumpingInTheDust, it feels amazing to #JumpInTheWater ----

Finn Esapekka Lappi (Toyota) finished third, 1:56.3 slower than Neuville with New Zealander Hayden Paddon (Hyundai) fourth and Norwegian Mads Ostberg (Citroen) fifth. AFP
