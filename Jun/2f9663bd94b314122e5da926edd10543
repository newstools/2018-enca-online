JOHANNESBURG – SANParks Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Fundisile Mketeni this week found himself having to help rangers chase and apprehend three suspected poachers during a visit to the Kruger National Park (KNP). The CEO worked his way up the structures of the organisation from being a ranger himself.

The suspects were ultimately arrested with the help of the K9 unit, a fixed-wing plane and the helicopter the CEO was flying in. The suspects were found in possession of a heavy calibre hunting rifle, ammunition, poaching equipment and a fresh pair of rhino horn. Mketeni said it was sad to see the carcass of a beautiful and magnificent species that had been roaming the wild areas of the KNP hours earlier, but was killed because of greed and criminality. “It was a privilege to work alongside the dedicated team of rangers and Air Wing colleagues, and participate in the apprehension of these suspects who have no regard for our laws and act with impunity,” he said.
