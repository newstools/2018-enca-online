JOHANNESBURG - It is do or die for the Sharks when they take on the Lions on Saturday. The Durban side is chasing the Rebels and Jaguares for a Super Rugby play-off spot and to do that they need to win their three remaining games. A talented Sharks side began the season with plenty of promise after an encouraging Super Rugby campaign in 2017. But 2018 has not gone according to plan, with a lack of consistency their main stumbling block. #SHAvLIO

Sharks Coach Rob Du Preez said, "We are going into a defining part of our season this is it you know. Every game is of great importance. We got to win every game but we are not looking any further than Saturday. It's a big one." With a host of players having been capped in the June international break, Du Preez has been able to name 14 Springboks in his matchday 23 for Saturday's clash. Press day for the Emirates Lions ahead of their Vodacom Super Rugby clash against the Cell C Sharks this weekend.#LetsUnite pic.twitter.com/QERpwxxltI Tendai Mtawarira who earned his 100th cap in the last test against England says the returning Boks have brought great energy to the franchise. "I think being part of the Bok setup you get to learn a lot, especially with Rassie being there." "I think we learnt a lot, including myself. What we learned there, we brought it back here and I think we are trying to have a similar environment at the Sharks. It does help to think along the same line." @STEVEHAAGSPORT @TheSharksZA CAP RUN pic.twitter.com/iHdSlRl3VS The Lions are head and shoulders above everyone else in the South African conference and haven’t lost to South African opposition in 21 matches. Whiteley returns to Vodacom Super Rugby action after injury side-lined him in March. Also back from injury is @M_marxi2 and @rosscronje9 while @Skosan14 should taste his first Super Rugby action of the year from the bench.#LetsUnite #SHAvLIO They will be wary however of a Sharks team that can be very dangerous on their day. eNCA
