KLAGENFURT, Austria - After eight months sidelined by a fractured foot, Manuel Neuer is set to pull on the Germany No.1 shirt on Saturday when they take on Austria in a rain-hit World Cup warm-up match. Look who's back...

Two weeks before Germany begin their World Cup campaign in Russia, Germany head coach Joachim Loew has named the Bayern goalkeeper in the starting side -- 259 days after his last match for his club. Loew has to cut his 27-man squad to 23 by Monday and the match against Austria is Neuer's only chance to prove his fitness before the World Cup finals. Neuer has not played since fracturing a metatarsal in his left foot last September in a recurrence of the same injury he suffered earlier in 2017. He last played for the national team in October 2016.

Germany kick off their title defence on June 17 in Moscow against Mexico. They also face Sweden and South Korea in Group F. Meanwhile, Freiburg striker Nils Petersen, the surprise inclusion in Loew's 27-man group, will make his international debut against Austria. Senior players Thomas Mueller, Mats Hummels and Toni Kroos are rested. AFP
