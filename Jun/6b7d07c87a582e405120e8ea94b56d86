"Karate is a very expensive sports and most of our tournaments are overseas in first world countries and that makes it a very costly affair, so you can imagine having to pay for your own Ticket, Hotel accommodation, Visa, Travel Insurance, Team kit / Tracksuit, your Gi which is your karate gear which is a heavy weight Gi and light weight Gi, Red and Blue Hand mitts, Red and Blue feet mitts, a Red and Blue karate Belt, a chest protector and Mouth guard, Food and Water Money, Transport and still being able to get Spending Money this is the type of funding Everyday single Karateka needs to compete at this level. So the trip with the visa alone is about R27 500 excluding the other thing's I've mentioned, so we really need funding from big companies and organizations."
