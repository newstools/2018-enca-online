In a statement, Numsa said Eskom claimed that ‘striking’ workers were responsible for sabotaging the power supply, resulting in load shedding. Numsa says its members are not on strike. "Our members, together with the NUM (National Union of Mineworkers), picketed and demonstrated on Thursday at various Eskom plants across the country," Numsa said.
