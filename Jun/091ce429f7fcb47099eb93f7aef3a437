KAZAN – Paul Pogba scored a late goal to earn France a hard-fought 2-1 win against Australia as technology played a major part in their opening World Cup Group C game on Saturday. Midfielder Pogba, who was criticised after recent below-par performances, found the back of the net with a lob after a fine one-two with second-half substitute Olivier Giroud nine minutes from time, the effort being confirmed by goal-line technology.
