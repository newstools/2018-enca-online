READ: Authorities prepare for Workers' Day traffic on the N3 after violent protests According to Con Roux of the N3 Toll Concession: “We had such a big effort to get the N3 reopened after what happened at the Mooi River area. We had traffic flowing well and smoothly throughout the day, peaking at traffic volumes of about 200 vehicles per hour. And then we had this unfortunate crash on top of Van Reenen's Pass. "There were indeed fatalities and it appears as though speed may have been involved. The backlog caused by this crash measures 10s of kilometres and the road was closed for about two-and-a-half hours and has now just been reopened”. eNCA
