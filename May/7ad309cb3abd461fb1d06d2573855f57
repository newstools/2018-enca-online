JOHANNESBURG - A Chinese Railway company has been implicated in a corruption scandal involving a Gupta-linked firm and Transnet. According to investigative journalism unit amaBhungane, China North Railway allegedly paid a middleman R647-million for a Transnet project worth R9-million. It's the second Chinese company to be linked to alleged corruption and a Gupta firm. WATCH: The Guptas’ Transnet saga Amabhungane journalist Susan Comrie says the contract was a small part of the R50-billion Transnet acquisition of 1,000 locomotives in 2014. "What we're talking about is a part of that contract where two suppliers were paid relocation fees in order to agree to have their cranes manufactured in Durban instead of Pretoria. The part that we're talking about is a R647-million payment that went to China North Railway. "What emerged is that there's a small payment that went to a very obscure little company ... Our investigations showed that behind that company there is a company linked to Salim Essa, which links back to Gupta boxes ... notorious for taking commission on Transnet deals." eNCA
