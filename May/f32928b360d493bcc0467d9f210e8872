PORT ELIZABETH - The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and five other parties on Thursday withdrew their motions of no confidence against Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor Athol Trollip. The EFF said the decision was made after balancing the conditions on the ground. It said the motion would be brought back at another time. Trollip faced a third attempt to remove him from office. The motion of no confidence was scheduled for Thursday after previous attempts descended into chaos. WATCH: Sitting for Athol Trollip no-confidence vote collapses Last month’s special sitting was indefinitely adjourned after a shouting match led to the collapse of the meeting. Efforts to remove him began when the DA refused to back an EFF-sponsored motion in Parliament to have the Constitution amended in favour of expropriation of land without compensation. eNCA
