JOHANNESBURG - There is still uncertainty over the friendly match between Absa Premiership champions Mamelodi Sundowns and La Liga champions Barcelona billed to take place next week. The match is billed to take place on Wednesday next week as part of the Nelson Mandela Centenary celebrations at FNB Stadium, Johannesburg. But Barcelona are yet to confirm if the match will take place and many think they are unlikely to do so given that the La Liga season is not yet over.

Striker Percy Tau said it would be great if it happened, to see people "that we see on TV playing Champions League and La Liga" "It’s not only special for me but to all South Africans, people in Africa, the whole world to see Barcelona playing against a South African team. If it were to happen it would be great for a  lot of people,” Tau said. eNCA
