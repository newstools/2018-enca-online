JOHANNESBURG - Police must speed up their investigations and solve political killings that have marred the KwaZulu-Natal province ahead of next years general elections, said Inkatha Freedom Party MP Mkhuleko Hlengwa on Saturday. He was reacting to the death of his friend and IFP councillor Sibuyiselo Dlamini, 35, who was gunned down on Friday night. READ: More political killings in KwaZulu-Natal "The IFP is concerned if it is a political killing. We don't want the election activity to be compromised by violence. We are calling on all political parties to ensure that we are working together with communities and police so these criminals can be caught. We are sick and tired of this violence, police must quicken their investigation," he said. Hlengwa also accused police of not making progress in cases that involve killings of IFP councillors and members. "Police are not making headway in solving the killings of IFP councillors and members. This is an ongoing trend we have observed, the police service needs introspection and ensure that it has the necessary capacity," he said. The slain councillor served as the IFP Youth Brigade chairperson in Zululand district before joining the Zululand district municipality as a councillor. He also served as a member of the IFP national council, the party's highest decision-making body in between conferences. eNCA
