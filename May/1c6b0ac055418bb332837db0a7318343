		Trump has extended tariff negotiations for a month with Mexico, Canada and the European Union and agreed on permanent exemptions for Argentina, Australia and Brazil. Trump’s administration says it’s focusing on quotas that restrain imports, prevent trans-shipment and protect national security. But South Africa described the US move as unfair, saying some of the exempted countries are big steel and aluminium exporters. Pretoria says however that negotiations with the US, will continue. eNCA
