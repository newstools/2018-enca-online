The latest incidence of the disease comes less than a year after the central African country's last outbreak, in which eight people were infected of whom four died. Ebola is believed to be spread over long distances by bats, which can host the virus without dying, as it infects other animals it shares trees with such as monkeys. It often spreads to humans via infected bushmeat.
