"About 48,177 households have been displaced so far and this translates to 260,200 people that are displaced," he said. Gullet said more than 21,000 acres of crops had been destroyed and some 20,000 animals washed away, while more than 100 schools had been affected, many of which remain closed. The disaster comes after three failed rainy seasons inflicted a crippling drought that sent food prices soaring and left more than three million people requiring food aid. AFP
