The Department of Human Settlements in a statement on Sunday strongly condemned the violent protest which erupted in Parkwood. "While we respect the people’s right to protest, violence and destruction cannot be tolerated," it said. "We urge the community to remain calm.  The government cannot condone lawlessness." eNCA
