JOHANNESBURG – Government plans to spend nearly R90,000 to replace each bucket toilet in the country, the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) said on Tuesday. In a statement, Outa said the figure is revealed in the Department of Water and Sanitation Affairs' 2018/2019 budget, which shows it plans to spend R1.048-billion to replace 11,844 bucket toilets this year, which works out to R88,500 per toilet. WATCH: Checkpoint: Sanitary Hell “Overspending on the BEP (Bucket Eradication Programme) captures the essence of the department’s financial mismanagement, which will be placed under a microscope in the forthcoming parliamentary inquiry,” Outa's portfolio manager for water and environment, Yamkela Ntola said. In 2016, then-Minister of Water and Sanitation, Nomvula Mokonyane, stated that the bucket toilet system is “the most degrading legacy of apartheid”. But, "under her leadership, there has been no commitment to the eradication of bucket toilets, only a waste of public funds," Outa said. "The Department of Water and Sanitation’s Bucket Eradication Programme (BEP) is a way of spending with no end in sight and not a great deal of delivery."
