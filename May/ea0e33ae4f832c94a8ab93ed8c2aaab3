JOHANNESBURG – African Swine Fever, a severe haemorrhagic disease of pigs, has been reported in South Africa's Northern Cape Province, the Department of Agriculture said on Thursday. The virus, which is not transmitted to humans, can result in "a great number of the death of pigs in a short span of time" and is transmitted by contact with infected pigs, ticks or feeding of infected swill, the department said in a statement. South Africa previously had an outbreak of African Swine Fever in 2016. This is a developing story. Reuters
