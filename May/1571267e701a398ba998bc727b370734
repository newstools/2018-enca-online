JOHANNESBURG - Corruption-hit Steinhoff says its acting chief executive, Danie van der Merwe, has paid back the R26-million he took a week before the company’s share collapsed. The timing of the loan raises questions about how much Van der Merwe knew about the financial malpractice that has brought the company to the brink of collapse. His personal investment company, Ruby Street Investments, borrowed the funds from 29 November last year. That was the day that companies owned by Steinhoff's former CEO, Markus Jooste, and his son-in-law Stefan Potgieter took a R93-million loan from the same bank. WATCH: How Steinhoff execs cooked the books Van der Merwe was sued alongside Jooste and Potgieter by Johannesburg-based Investec, days after the Steinhoff share collapse. Steinhoff reported accounting irregularities on 5 December, causing its share to crash more than 80 percent in three days. eNCA
