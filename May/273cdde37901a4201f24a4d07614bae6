The said educators will be on precautionary suspension from the school before the end of this week. A disciplinary hearing will be held at a later stage. "There was an allegation that learners were smeared with deep heat on their private parts. No evidence was found, we strongly believe that the culture of silence might have played a major role. On allegations that learners were compelled to use the same blade to shave, a new process must be implemented with immediate effect to avert such unhygienic practices," the department said in a statement. The department also said no evidence was found that strippers were brought to the school hostel night parties. Lesufi criticised the sale of alcohol in the school environment and advised that the Liquor license granted to the bar be revoked. According to the department, the bar is located within the school precinct.
