There were three main areas of discussion. The first was what can member boards do to create a better atmosphere of respect between teams and to provide for a fair contest on the field of play. The second was what it means to play in the spirit of cricket.

The Cricket Committee made a series of recommendations to be shared with the Chief Executives’ Committee in June as part of the collective desire to create a culture of respect and protect the spirit of the game. It was up in the air for a moment, but the ICC Cricket Committee have declared the toss will remain part of Test cricket.
