Sitting at my table I sit with people who’re doing a lot of things for communities. When we came up with this notion of Thuma Mina, the inspiration came from what the Muslim community does, helping people who’re in need. I thank you for that. I have no doubt that you will continue to positively contribute by lending a hand to many lives that need a hand," Ramaphosa said. eNCA
