LONDON - British financial regulators slapped Barclays chief executive Jes Staley with an R10-million fine for trying to uncover the identity of a whistle-blower. The Financial Conduct Authority said the head of the UK-based bank breached the standard of care required of executives and his conduct undermined the confidence in Barclay’s whistleblowing procedures.
