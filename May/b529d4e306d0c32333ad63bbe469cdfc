JOHANNESBURG - Cosatu will be having a closed-door meeting with President Cyril Ramaphosa on Tuesday. The trade union federation says it's not happy with some decisions taken by his administration. Cosatu spokesperson Sizwe Phamla said the recent agreement with independent power producers would result to job losses at Eskom.
	
	"Of course we are unhappy. That is why we need to have honest conversations behind closed doors," said Phamla.

All these issues will need (us to) have those conversations in private." eNCA
