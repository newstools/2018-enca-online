JOHANNESBURG – The South Gauteng High Court on Tuesday postponed the criminal trial of former South African Police Service (SAPS) crime intelligence boss Richard Mdluli because one of the lawyers failed to turn up. Mdluli and his co-accused Mthembeni Mthunzi face charges of intimidation, kidnapping, assault with the intent to commit grievous bodily harm and defeating the ends of justice. They have both pleaded not guilty to all the charges. The state alleges that the accused intimidated, kidnapped and assaulted Mdluli's love rival, Oupa Ramogibe, before he was shot dead in 1999.

In January, then-police minister Fikile Mbalula fired Mdluli, who had been on suspension for six years, from his duties as SAPS crime intelligence head. The matter was postponed to Friday.
