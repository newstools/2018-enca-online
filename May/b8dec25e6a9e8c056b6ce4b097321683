JOHANNESBURG - About 100 people are trying to occupy land illegally in Protea Glen, in the southwest of Johannesburg. One community leader says the government should give them the vacant property. He says authorities are dragging their feet and the people can build their own homes. At the beginning of the month, residents of Protea Glen came face to face with land invaders who arrived with spades and wheelbarrows to occupy a piece of land. WATCH: 'We're not here to cause trouble,' say Soweto land grabbers On Friday, residents of Zandspruit in northern Johannesburg invaded land in Honeydew. In March, a large group of people gathered in Marlboro, near Sandton, to stage a land grab. eNCA
