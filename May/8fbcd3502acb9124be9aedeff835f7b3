JOHANNESBURG – Transport Minister Blade Nzimande says he's confident unions and employers will reach agreement on the bus strike on Thursday. The strike has entered its third week, leaving commuters stranded across the country. Workers are demanding a 9,5 increase, while employers are offering 8 percent. READ: Nationwide bus strike drags on Nzimande says the strike should have been avoided from the start. “Today [Thursday] they will have settle because this is now reaching an unacceptable point. A strike for more than two weeks is not good for anybody. It’s not good for workers and it’s also not good for employers and attitudes tend to hearten. We were discussing yesterday with the minister of labour and we have been in touch with both parties urging them to please settle this and matters that can be dealt with afterwards let them agree, with time frames which was another thing we raised with them,” said Nzimande. “If you say a matter must go to a task team, set a time frame because workers rightly complain. Once the strike is off employers then it will take another year before they resolve a settlement, set a time frame so that you are able to sort out all the other problems as well. We are anxiously awaiting the outcome because it’s not acceptable that commuters are affected like that,” he said. eNCA
