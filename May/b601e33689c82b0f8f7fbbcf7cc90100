JOHANNESBURG - Police Minister Bheki Cele says it’s possible the bomb at the Verulam mosque was planted before he visited on Sunday. Police are none the wiser as to how the explosive device was taken into the mosque, at which three men were stabbed, one fatally, on Thursday. On Sunday night, the Imam Hussein Mosque was evacuated after the device was found under a chair. "It is a concern [the bomb] has been found, but up to this point, when it has been said it’s a kind of a bomb, it’s not been conclusively found out what kind of a bomb it is," Cele said.
