JOHANNESBURG - Patricia de Lille dropped a bombshell on Wednesday when she said on radio that DA leader Mmusi Maimane had offered her a position in Parliament, to step down as Cape Town's mayor. The Democratic Alliance on Tuesday rescinded De Lille's membership, thus stripping her of the mayoral position. #PatriciaDeLille says in court papers DA leadership offered her an MP position on Parliament if she vacated Mayoral office.... therefore disputed is not about her membership. pic.twitter.com/M2pfrAOA7D She is to challenge the party’s decision in court on Friday, and insists she is still mayor. But Ian Neilson, her deputy,  insists he has been appointed acting mayor. "There is no interdict or court order of any sort that has been served on the city in this matter. So the status quo recognised by the speaker, the city manager, is that she [De Lille] is not the mayor of the city anymore. They have both informed me that I hold the position of acting mayor and that I hold the responsibilities." Opposition parties have also weighed in on the matter. WATCH: Western Cape ANC weighs in on De Lille saga The ANC's former premier in the Western Cape, Ebrahim Rasool, said there was "an unconstitutional takeover and capture of the City of Cape Town by a factionalised if not racialised cabal in the DA". The ANC supported the move for an interdict to stop this from happening," Rasool said. Grant Haskin, an African Christian Democratic Party councillor, said the uncertainty was not healthy for the administration of the city. eNCA
