JOHANNESBURG – The family of the late Karabo Mokoena has welcomed the court's verdict handed down to her killer Sandile Mantsoe. On Wednesday the South Gauteng High Cour found Mantsoe guilty of killing his ex-girlfriend Mokoena.. “I was at the beginning a little bit sceptical, I am relieved even though I am a bit shaky, even though you can't see it but I am relieved and happy about the outcome,” said Lolo, Mokoena's mother. “I am also very happy, really indeed, God has done it... I'm here with mama as a spiritual mother for Karabo, I'm very pleased, thank you Lord,” she said. READ: Sandile Mantsoe found guilty of murder Mokoena’s charred remains were found in Lyndhurst.
