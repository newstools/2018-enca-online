JOHANNESBURG - The National Prosecuting Authority is confident it can successfully prosecute the Guptas despite the unfreezing of assets seized from the family, its companies and associates. Free State High Court judge Philip Loubser ruled that the NPA  had not provided enough evidence to reserve the assets, worth about R250-million. They include properties, aircraft and vehicles.

The seizure of the assets was part of the NPA investigation of the Free State dairy farm project. The NPA is yet to decide whether to appeal Loubser’s ruling. eNCA reporter Erin Bates spoke to NPA spokesman Luvuyo Mfaku about the implications for future prosecution of the Guptas. eNCA
