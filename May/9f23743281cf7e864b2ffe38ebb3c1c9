JOHANNESBURG - The Public Enterprises Department is continuing its review of the Transnet board despite the sudden resignation of its chairperson and two non-executive directors. Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan met with the state-owned company's board of directors on Friday, despite the resignation of chair Linda Mabaso, with immediate effect on Thursday. Non-executive directors Vusi Nkonyane and Yasmin Forbes also quit. In a statement, Gordhan said Transnet had become embroiled in serious corruption and state capture.

Analysts say Transnet, like other state-owned entities (SOEs), is suffering under serious governance issues. “A lot of the people are very compromised," says Siya Biniza, director at the think tank Political Economy Southern Africa. "The issues being uncovered at Transnet now are the similar kind of issues that were dragged across into Eskom. If you look at the executives you’ll notice that it’s the same kind of people. [Anoj] Singh was CFO of Transnet before leaving to become CFO at Eskom. The trail of financial mismanagement and irregular expenditure has been following him throughout.” Biniza says. The Public Enterprises Department says it will return SOEs to financial sustainability by putting proper boards and management teams in place. But Biniza says directors and board members should be held personally responsible for financial losses. “We need to recover the losses in terms of monies being irregularly spent as a result of escalating costs and fruitless procurement without any goods being delivered. We need to recover that from the people found guilty. We need to work around the legislation so that it enables the government to do that.” eNCA
