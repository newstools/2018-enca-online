Some social media users slammed the company for not considering the demographics of South Africa while others saw nothing wrong with the advert. That Mercedes Benz Mother’s Day video doesn’t show any racism. People are always in their feels, not everything has to be about black or white. I personally dont see anything wrong with that Mercedes Benz mothers day Vid. I mean it was only one woman throughout. South Africans are quick to play the race card SMH! The debate quickly turned into a hilarious conversation as some users called out those who slammed the company.
