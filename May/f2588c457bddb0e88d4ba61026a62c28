JOHANNESBURG – The Hawks on Thursday welcomed the hefty prison sentence handed to a bank robbery syndicate duo. Lucky Dube and Xolani Nxumalo, both aged 44, were sentenced to 18 and 15 years direct imprisonment respectively. The decision was handed down in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court. They were convicted for a June 2014 bank robbery in Vosloours where they got away with approximately R1.7-million.

Clients and staff were then held up at gunpoint as the men ransacked the bank. “A multidisciplinary intelligence-driven operation was conducted and the Hawks arrested the pair in October 2015,” the crime fighting body said in a statement. “Nxumalo was arrested in Klerksdorp robbing a bank, whilst Dube was traced and arrested in Auckland Park. “Both Nxumalo and Dube still have other pending cases of armed robbery in various courts in Gauteng, Mpumalanga and the North West, respectively.” eNCA
