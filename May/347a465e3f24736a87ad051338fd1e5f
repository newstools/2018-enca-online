JOHANNESBURG – Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs has fallen way behind in its schedule to launch an official inquiry into the early naturalisation of the Gupta family. Last June, House chairperson, Cedric Frolic, called on four committees to investigate state capture. On Wednesday,  the Home Affairs Committee heard how the department is not assisting it in its investigations and how despite this, it’s going to broaden the scope of its investigation. The inquiry into State Capture will now not only deal with the early naturalisation of the Gupta family but whether they did indeed donate money to schools and charities in the North West Province as stated in their applications. READ: Was the Gupta's naturalisation legal? There is the possibility that former NW Premier Supra Muhamapeelo could be called to testify as well as Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba The committee also wants to investigate the so-called fireblade fight between the Oppenheimers and the Guptas for a private airport and whether Minister Gigaba played any role. Meanwhile, MPs want to know if the passports of several Gupta members now on the run have been confiscated as they had asked. It’s likely the inquiry will only start in the next Parliamentary term but new chair Patrick Chauke warned his MPs to not accept any bribes from people carrying large suitcases full of cash on behalf of a powerful family. eNCA
