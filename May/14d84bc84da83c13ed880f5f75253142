The South African Reserve Bank said in March it had placed the small lender under curatorship because of liquidity issues.

It said the decision followed confirmation from the municipalities involved that they did not have the capacity to comply with an instruction from the National Treasury to investigate and report on the circumstances surrounding their investments.

The West Rand district municipality has R81-million invested with VBS Mutual Bank while Merafong has R50-million. The curatorship means the municipalities cannot access the funds. African News Agency
