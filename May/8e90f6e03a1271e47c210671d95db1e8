MIDRAND - The African Union Commission (AUC) chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat vowed to fight sexual discrimination against women and called for the Pan African Parliament (PAP) to be given full legislative powers to help address the problems facing the continent. Mahamat made his comments at a press conference, and as PAP's guest of honour, following the opening ceremony of the Sixth Ordinary Session of PAP’s Fourth Parliament in Midrand on Monday.

The issue of peace and security was something that also needed to be addressed even though there had been an improvement in the security situation in Africa. "In some parts of Africa, there remain challenges in regard to terrorism and human trafficking. Stability through good governance and human rights are linked to these issues which in turn are contingent on empowering women, youth and civil society because these unresolved issues are the root causes of the problems facing Africa," he said.

"The AU has been built on gender equality and during my appointment, I've appointed more women than men into important positions and this was not because I was doing women a favour but because of their natural abilities and the important roles they perform in society it was natural to appoint them. "I'm committed to getting rid of gender discrimination and sanctions will be imposed on anybody or person we find discriminating against women," the AUC head said. African News Agency
