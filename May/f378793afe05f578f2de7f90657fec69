UNITED NATIONS - UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday called for calm in the Central African Republic, where at least 24 people were killed in attacks in the capital Bangui targeting a church and a mosque. The violence erupted when men in a well-known local militia group rammed through a roadblock on Tuesday. Armed men then stormed a church in the middle of a service, killing worshippers and a priest. In response, a mob burned a mosque and lynched two people believed to be Muslim.
