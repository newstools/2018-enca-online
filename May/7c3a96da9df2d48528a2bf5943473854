JOHANNESBURG – The Sandton Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) is planning to lay criminal charges against a motorist who dumped the body of a dog in Kensington earlier this week, the organisation said on Thursday.

The dumping of the animal was caught on film and immediately went viral. A well-dressed motorist got out of his silver Mercedes Benz, opened the boot of the vehicle, and looked around several times before carelessly tossing the carcass onto the road," said Sandton SPCA general manager Jaco Pieterse. He said it is not clear what caused the dog's death, but the animal's body will be sent for a post-mortem.
