LONDON - Manchester United great Paul Scholes has warned Alexis Sanchez he must improve following his lacklustre display in Saturday's FA Cup final defeat by Chelsea, saying his performances "can't get any worse". Former United midfielder Scholes singled out Chile international Sanchez for criticism after a match United lost 1-0 at Wembley, with Chelsea playmaker Eden Hazard scoring the only goal of the game from the penalty spot.

"They need two magical players. I think they've got really good players, they haven't got a Hazard, [Cristiano] Ronaldo, [Lionel] Messi, and I know many teams haven't, but the difference between the two was the quality in Hazard, we saw that in big games. United don't have that." AFP
