JOHANNESBURG - Sandile Mantsoe, convicted this week of the gruesome killing of his 22-year-old girlfriend Karabo Mokoena, should be sentenced to life in prison, the African National Congress Women's League (ANCWL) said on Thursday. UPDATE: Sandile Mantsoe found guilty of murder "The ANCWL is unapologetic in calling for maximum jail sentences for those convicted for the barbaric gruesome killings of women and all forms of gender-based violence.Â  No Judge must have a single iota of mercy when sentencing such monsters," the ANCWL said in a statement as sentencing proceedings took place in the high court in Johannesburg on Thursday. On Wednesday, Mantsoe was found guilty of murdering Mokoena, setting her body alight and dumping it in a field in Lyndhurst. The ANCWL congratulated the State for getting a conviction in the case which made headlines last year and cast a spotlight on gender-based violence in South Africa. "He must be given maximum jail sentence with no option to parole. That might serve as a deterrent to others who are thinking of committing such barbaric gruesome acts. African News Agency
