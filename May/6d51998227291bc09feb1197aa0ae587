SA Reserve Bank MPC PRETORIA – Interest rates have been kept on hold, South African Reserve Bank (Sarb) Governor Lesetja Kganyago announced on Thursday. The decision comes after a meeting of the central bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) in Pretoria. This means the repo rate, the rate at which Sarb lends money to banks, will remain unchanged at 6.5 percent. The prime lending rate, the rate at which banks borrow to consumers, stays put at 10 percent.
