JOHANNESBURG – The Gupta family and their associates have lost an application for leave to appeal a coourt ruling ordering the grounding and safekeeping of their aeroplane. The South Gauteng High court ordered them to pay costs. [JUST IN] #GuptaPlane Atul Gupta, his wife Chetali, Westdawn and its owner Oakbay have lost an application for leave to appeal a ruling on 19 March 2018 ordering the grounding and safekeeping the half-a-billion-rand aircraft they were leasing. They have been ordered to pay costs. The plane, which was financed by a Canadian agency, EDC and owned by Stoneriver, was grounded in March. The Guptas were given 15 days to return the jet to a hangar at Lanseria airport. The family then lodged leave to appeal this ruling. [BREAKING] #GuptaPlane Kathree-Setiloane says "it is not in the interest of justice that leave to appeal is justice" and the application is dismissed on the grounds that the order is not appealable. The order is handed down with costs. eNCA
