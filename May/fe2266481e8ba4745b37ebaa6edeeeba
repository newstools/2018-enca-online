PORT ELIZABETH - The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality (NMBM) says taps have been turned back on across the metro, despite the city losing as much as 60 percent of its daily supply. A broken water pump caused major disruptions at a treatment plant. Work continued throughout the night to repair it. It comes as the city is facing a worsening water shortage problem. Mayor Athol Trollip is pleading with residents to limit their consumption to 50 litres per person per day, as combined dam levels have dipped below 24 percent.
