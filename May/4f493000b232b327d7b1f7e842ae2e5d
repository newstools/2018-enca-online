JOHANNESBURG - Protea Glen in Soweto was calm on Tuesday afternoon after land invaders came face to face with residents in the area on Tuesday morning. A group armed with spades and wheelbarrows invaded a piece of land. The police were called to the area. Concerned home-owners are frustrated and say they want to keep the neighbourhood safe for their children to play in. According to one resident, the land invaders said they wanted to build taverns in the area. @HermanMashaba people of Protea Glen Extension 29 need your help with this land invation happening now @CityofJoburgZA pic.twitter.com/RLCv5zLS4b Those seeking land have defended their move, saying they don't want to cause trouble and are simply fleeing impoverished conditions. eNCA
