JOHANNESBURG - Retired Justice Dikgang Moseneke has donated R400,000 of the fees he earned as chairman of the Life Esidimeni arbitration hearings to the law school of the University of the Western Cape (UWC) The university says it will match Moseneke's donation. Moseneke says UWC is one of three universities he has chosen to donate to. ''On Monday, at a ceremony attended by UWC rector professor Tyrone Pretorius, Judge Moseneke committed around R400,000 to law students who excelled in their final LLB year of their LLB and the LLM degree,'' the UWC said in a statement. ''In turn, the university pledged to match Moseneke’s donation to assist in promoting excellence within the law faculty. Moseneke said the university’s law faculty was his first choice of institutions to whom he wanted to donate his fees.''

This is an attempt to identify and encourage excellence, hard work and commitment to achieve outstanding results,' he said.' In February, Moseneke ordered that the families of each of the Life Esidimeni victims receive R1-million in compensation from the government. More than 140 psychiatric patients died after being transferred from the Life Esidimeni facility to unlicensed NGOs across Gauteng, drawing widespread outcry from the public and opposition parties. The botched transfers to NGOs between 2015 and 2016 resulted in patients dying of hunger, cold, dehydration and general lack of care. African News Agency
