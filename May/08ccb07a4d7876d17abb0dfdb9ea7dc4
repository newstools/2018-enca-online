PRETORIA - The Pretoria Regional Court on Thursday ruled that a case against the 45-year-old man, who was accused of raping his parents’ domestic worker and forcing her to perform sexual acts with his two dogs, must be transferred back to the Bronkhorstspruit Regional Court. On 24 April, the Bronkhorstspruit Magistrate’s Court ruled that the case must be transferred to the Pretoria Regional Court for the safety of the accused and court personnel. Members of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) opposed the transfer and threatened to burn the Bronkhorstspruit Magistrate’s Court building if the transfer was not revoked. “The people in charge of security have insisted that the safety of the accused and other people in Bronkhorstspruit can be secured,” said Pretoria Regional Court Magistrate, who was identified only as Ms M Louw, while delivering judgment. It also emerged in court that the decision to transfer the case was inspired by an incident on 14 November, in which the Bronkhorstspruit Magistrate’s Court building was damaged, allegedly by irate community members after farmers Johannes Potgieter and Hendrick Dumas - arrested for allegedly handcuffing a nine-year-old girl before beating her and shooting at her - were granted bail. The application against the transfer of the case on Thursday, was brought by State Prosecutor Matric Luphondo, who argued that the matter was not properly vetted before a decision was taken. “The accused also says he feels safe in Bronkhorstspruit. If there was any disruption since this case started in Bronkhorstspruit that could have been a justification. I’m also concerned about my safety in Bronkhorstspruit, but I cannot say this matter must not be heard in Bronkhorstspruit because of the Dumas case.” The man is facing 10 charges, including rape, sexual assault and malicious damage to property. He was arrested in November last year. The incident allegedly happened in Riamar Park, Bronkhorstspruit, on 23 October. African News Agency
