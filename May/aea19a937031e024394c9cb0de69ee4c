TURIN, Italy - A young Turin-based artist has spent months sculpting a life-size Fiat 500 car out of a 15-tonne block of white Carrara marble in a work he sees as a critique of today's consumerist, throw-away society. Armed with his circular saw and a face mask to keep away the dust, Nazareno Biondo began work on the piece last year, slowly and meticulously hewing out of stone a copy of the iconic "Topolino", the original small two-door rear-engined city car that still symbolises, 60 years after its launch, Italy's post-war economic boom.

Biondo, who graduated from Turin's Albertina Academy of Fine Arts, specialises in working with marble, and has already carved gold ingots, bundles of dollars and even a Vespa motor scooter out of the white stone.

Once it is completed, probably in a few months, the work will look like a car ready for the scrapyard, "because my pieces are a reflection of consumerism, of the waste of contemporary society," he said.
