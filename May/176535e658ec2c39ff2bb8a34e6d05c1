NKANDLA - People organising a prayer meeting for former president Jacob Zuma in his hometown of Nkandla say it’s simply to thank him for the good work he’s done. Religious leaders say it’s long overdue. "We feel that Msholozi is appearing in court, back in the province and we have not held a prayer session," said organiser Vusi Dibe. INFOGRAPHIC: Key dates in Zuma's presidency "This should have happened a long time ago, just to say thank you for what you've done for the nation." Zuma resigned earlier this year after the ANC asked him to step down. He’ll appear in the KwaZulu-Natal High Court in Durban on corruption charges, next week. eNCA
