COLIGNY - An Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) controlled ward must be exemplary, party leader Julius Malema has said. "Let us start taking care of ourselves. You must start by removing heaps of refuse, let us not wait for the municipality," Malema told party members in Tlhabologang near Coligny on Wednesday during a by-election victory celebration. Malema said EFF councillors must serve the community and be accessible 24 hours a day. "As a councillor, I know you are going to buy a car, that car must take pregnant women to the clinic or hospital, that car must take elderly people to pay points to get their social grants.
