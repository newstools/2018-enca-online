JOHANNESBURG – Ashwin Willemse, Nick Mallett and Naas Botha will be taken off the air this weekend, SuperSport said in a statement on Friday. It comes after discussions following Willemse’s studio walk-out were not resolved. “We have had discussions this week with all parties in an effort to resolve this matter amicably and expeditiously but despite good progress initially, the matter has unfortunately not been resolved,” the sports broadcaster said. WATCH: A look at the challenges faced by black rugby players SuperSport has now decided to instruct an independent senior counsel, Advocate Vincent Maleka SC, to chair a review of the incident which occurred and to make recommendations to the company's management. "Pending the outcome of the review, the three presenters involved will not appear on-air," it said. None of the presenters has been suspended and "they will continue to be remunerated in terms of their contracts." Supersport said it is committed to getting to the bottom of this "serious issue." Maleka was asked to make findings and recommendations by Monday, June 11, 2018. eNCA
