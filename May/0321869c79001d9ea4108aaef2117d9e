Mubi resident Abdullahi Labaran said the first bomber mingled with worshippers who had gathered for prayers at the mosque at the edge of the market. He detonated his explosives "five minutes before the prayer started" at about 1:20 pm (1220 GMT). The second bomber blew himself up among the crowds of worshippers, traders and shoppers who fled the mosque towards the butchery section of a nearby market.

It has been repeatedly targeted in deadly attacks blamed on Boko Haram since it was briefly overrun by the militant group in late 2014. On November 21, 2017 at least 50 people were killed when a suicide bomber blew himself up in a mosque during early morning prayers in the Unguwar Shuwa area of Mubi. In October 2012, at least 40 people were killed in an attack on student housing in Mubi that was widely blamed on Boko Haram. In June 2014, at least 40 football supporters, including women and children, died in a bomb attack after a match in the Kabang area of the town. AFP
