JOHANNESBURG – Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) said it urgently needs cash to pay social grants in June. The company's lawyers report that neither the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) nor Treasury has paid CPS since April 1. [JUST IN] #SocialGrants Lawyers' letter to Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng dated 23 May 2018 reads, "CPS has been unable to invoice @OfficialSASSA and has consequently received no payment whatsoever from either SASSA or @TreasuryRSA for services rendered by it since 1 April 2018." CPS representatives have now written to Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng. In March, the Constitutional Court granted a six-month extension for CPS to continue paying social grants.
