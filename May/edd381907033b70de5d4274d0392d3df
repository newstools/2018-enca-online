JOHANNESBURG - Residents of Marievale in Nigel have succeeded in getting an eviction order against them declared illegal. The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) evicted them from an army base on the East Rand in November. The North Gauteng High Court has ruled that the residents be allowed to return home or be given alternative accommodation within 30 days. The SANDF has also been ordered not to intimidate, harass or threaten the Marievale community. eNCA
