JOHANNESBURG – Trouble is once again brewing between Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta’s ruling Jubilee Party and opposition leader Raila Odinga’s Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party, despite their March 9 “handshake” deal to reach a compromise following months of political turmoil. Odinga returns home on Wednesday after a week-long trip to London, but he will be welcomed, not by the amity he left behind, but by growing political animosity that is putting his unity pact with Kenyatta to the test, Kenya’s Daily Nation reported on Wednesday. This, according to the publication, is after Kenyatta rebuffed his call for a referendum to change the Constitution and alter the structure of the Executive, and devolution if their deal is to succeed. READ: Kenya's Odinga swears himself in as 'People's president' Odinga’s “lieutenants were, for the third day running, trading barbs with Deputy President William Ruto, whom they accuse of attempting to use the handshake to his advantage in the 2022 State House race,” The publication said.
