DURBAN - Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini KaBhekuzulu has used his acceptance speech at the University of Zululand to lash out at the university. The University of Zululand bestowed an honorary doctorate on him in recognition of his philanthropic work to alleviate poverty and suffering in his community. However, Zwelithini, accused the institution of failing to advance the development of African scholarship to replace western ideas. “One might ask, why is it that after so many years after the establishment of our institutions of higher learning ... rural development, which we all know is a reference to us as Africans, still receive no attention at all,” he said. “If it does, it's merely a reference point for international donors and NGOs. There are no concrete plans and budget for it. “Universities instead have created a curriculum on poverty studies. I’m sure, ladies and gentlemen, you’ll agree with me that this has become an era of glorifying poverty instead of designing courses to overcome it and developing capacity for development of the people and the environment in which they live. “So then, from where I stand, the possible answer from where I stand is that institutions such as UniZulu have failed to develop African scholarships to the level of replacing western ideation.” Zwelithini was being recognised for his work in combating social ills among the youth. Deputy President David Mabuza on Friday applauded the king for his contribution to the fight against HIV. “Only those who deliberately refuse to be witness to the progress you have made in changing the lives of the people of this province,” Mabuza said. “Only those who close their eyes cannot hear the testimonies of the lives being changed for the better by the work of the majesty. In His Majesty we find an extraordinary South African, a torchbearer leading South Africa and KwaZulu-Natal to proscribe HIV and Aida to the dustbin of history.” Zwelinti used the occasion on Friday to speak about the Ingonyama Trust and social grants, among others, saying grants make people lazy. eNCA
