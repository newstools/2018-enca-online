JOHANNESBURG – Parliament’s Joint Committee on Ethics and Members’ Interests have agreed to places MPs Mduduzi Manana and Bongani Bongo before a disciplinary hearing. The committee has come under increasing criticism for failing to act against errant public office bearers. Manana, the former Deputy Minister of Education was found guilty of assaulting three women last year, while Bongo is accused of bribery during his tenure State Security Minister. Several rights groups reported Manana to the committee last year after he was found guilty of assault. LISTEN: Manana caught on tape offering money to his domestic worker He received a fine and 500 hours of community service and avoided a jail term which is how he remains an MP. But the ethics committee did nothing. Manana, however, faces another charge of assault, this time by his domestic worker. She withdrew the charges but prosecuting authorities asked the police to investigate. His questionable conduct has been sent to the committee for investigation by the Speaker. The Ethics committee can only fine or reprimands MPs and it’s up to a political party to recall or dismiss one of its members eNCA
