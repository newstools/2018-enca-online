JOHANNESBURG - The government might not sell part of its stake in Telkom after all. The communications giant says it hasn't heard anything further about such plans. Last year, then finance minister Malusi Gigaba suggested there was a possibility the government could sell some of its Telkom shares to fill a gap in the fiscus. “The government has not officially told us what it’s going to do,” said Telkom Group CEO Sipho Maseko. “Our sense is that they have probably gone away. If you recall at the time the government wanted to sell because they were at risk of a potential ratings downgrade. “Number one, the fiscal position of the country was very precarious, in the last budget cycle, the government took steps to improve the fiscal position and I think that’s gotten a lot better.

" The government has found other levers to generate revenue rather than just selling off assets. We think it may go away, but they haven’t officially confirmed that to us in a letter. All we want, however, is...  certainty for our shareholders and the government is a large enough shareholder that the rest of the shareholders are interested." eNCA
