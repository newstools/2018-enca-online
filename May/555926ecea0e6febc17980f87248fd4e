JOHANNESBURG - The crippling national bus strike that has left thousands of commuters frustrated for weeks is finally over. Last week, employers and unions reached agreement on wage increases. But talks stalled on the issue of back-pay, with employers saying the increases would only become effective once agreed upon officially. Employers had maintained that no back-pay was due to striking employees. Employees affiliated to the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union (Satawu) then held back on signing the deal. But the impasse has come to an end. #BusStrike Numsa’s Irvin Jim “what delayed the end of strike was employers not wanting to back date pay. But we have secured that employers will backdate pay now. pic.twitter.com/WYYgwV2ssp READ: Bus unions' back pay demands hold up deal Bus services could return to normal as early as Tuesday morning. Econometrix Chief Economist Azar Jamine says the wage offer the unions have agreed to is a big victory. “The kind of wage increase that they’re getting is the kind of increase that many would love to get. They’re getting way, way above that and will certainly see an increase in their living standards," says Jamine. eNCA
