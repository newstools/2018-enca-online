According to eMedia Investments Chief Executive Officer, André van der Veen, OpenNews will launch in the last quarter of 2018 and will have its own management and identity, and will and look distinctively different from eNCA, the company’s existing news channel on DStv. “OpenNews will be offering viewers an integrated news channel combining short format news, on-screen information, and links with selected social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram, and a proprietary app," Van der Veen said. "eMedia Investments has the talent, knowledge and experience to launch South Africa’s first satellite free-to-air television news channel. OpenNews will be an independent news service, but hosts will be encouraged to ‘to take a view’ on regional, international, sports, entertainment and financial news.” According to Van der Veen, the OpenNews line-up will include syndicated content from the eMedia stable, such as the recently-launched entertainment programme, The Spotlight with Tanya Nefdt, and two new current affairs shows – The Tim Modise Network and The Fix with Karima Brown.
