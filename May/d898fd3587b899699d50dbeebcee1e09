CHENNAI - South Africa bowler Lungi Ngidi has made a successful start to his first stint in the Indian Premier League for the Chennai Super Kings. The 22-year-old warmed the bench at the start of the tournament. Then, he travelled back home to South Africa following his father's demise. He returned to India and rejoined the Chennai squad. He might have been back on the bench, but an injury to Deepak Chahar paved the way for Ngidiâ€™s introduction and he made his presence felt straightaway against the Delhi Daredevils. His figures of 1/26 from his four overs were especially brilliant as the debutant bowled two overs in the Powerplay, and the remaining two at the death against the Daredevils on April 30. #IPL weekly catch-up: Virat Kohli's mounting problems at #RCB, Rashid Khan's century, and Lungi Ngidi's terrific debut. https://t.co/CaBcwyNSJi pic.twitter.com/vSplI2yP8P Chennai would go on to win the match by 13 runs in a high-scoring affair.
