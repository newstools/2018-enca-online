JOHANNESBURG - A 38-year-old man, linked to the violence at the notorious Glebelands hostel in KwaZulu-Natal, was on Tuesday sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for attempted murder in the Scottsburg Regional Court, provincial police said. Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said police traced the man who remained very elusive to the Harding area where he was arrested. READ: Two killed at notorious Glebelands hostel The suspect was charged with an attempted murder case where Fezeka Njiyelo, 29, was shot and wounded in 2016 at the Glebelands Hostel and was sentenced to ten years imprisonment. The suspect will also be charged with two counts of murder where two Glebelands Hostel residents were killed at Montclair in 2015. He will appear at the Umlazi Magistrates Court on Wednesday and is expected to join the seven other suspects whose bail was successfully opposed. “In September 12, 2015, at 15.15, William Mthembu and Thokozani Machi were exiting a supermarket in Montclair when they were attacked. “It is alleged that the suspect shot and killed them before fleeing in their getaway vehicle. A murder docket was opened at the Montclair police station. It was immediately established that the victims were from the Glebelands Hostel and that their murder was linked to the tensions in the hostel at that time and the Detective Task Team immediately took over the investigation,” said Zwane.
