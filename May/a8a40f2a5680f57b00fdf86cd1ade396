CAPE TOWN – The ANC Western Cape says Patricia de Lille’s dismissal is plunging the Cape Town Metro into an even deeper crisis. It follows the DA's decision on Tuesday to expel De Lille from the party. The ANC says De Lille’s removal has revealed the DA’s true colours. “The Democratic Alliance’s baffling attempt to axe Patricia de Lille as mayor of the City of Cape Town has plunged one of the country’s big metros into an even deeper crisis," said ANC Western Cape Secretary Faiez Jacobs. Jacobs said the DA is a racist, elitist party which aims to protect white privilege at the expense of African, coloured and Indian communities. eNCA
