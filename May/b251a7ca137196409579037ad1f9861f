Her effort in Doha earned her fifth place, with Ivory Coast's Marie-Josee Talou being the fastest woman on the night in 10.85. On the triple jump scene, Khotso Mokoena's best effort on the night of 16.92 metres, saw him end in sixth place, with Pedro Pichardo of Cuba winning with a distance of 17.95.
