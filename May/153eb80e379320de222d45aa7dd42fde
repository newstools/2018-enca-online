		Look at how much it means to him. Look at how much it means to them fans -- pic.twitter.com/nXpUxQEyYL After a 5-2 first-leg win last week, a 4-2 defeat on the night could not prevent the five-time champions from reaching their first final since 2007. Jurgen Klopp's men built on their Anfield victory with first-half strikes from Sadio Mane and Georginio Wijnaldum sandwiching an unfortunate James Milner own goal. We've conquered all of Europe,
		We're never gonna stop.
		From Paris down to Turkey,
		We've won the fucking lot.
		
		Bob Paisley and Bill Shankly,
		The fields of Anfield Road.
		We are loyal supporters,
		And we come from Liverpool.
		
		Allez, Allez, Allez, Allez, Allez, Allez... pic.twitter.com/Wsm0nY7dVy Needing four unanswered goals to force extra time, Roma piled on the pressure in the second half but failed to repeat their incredible quarter-final comeback against Barcelona despite Edin Dzeko finding the net and a late double from Radja Nainggolan.
