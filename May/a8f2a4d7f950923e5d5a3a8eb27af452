JOHANNESBURG - The Legoland Windsor resort in England has built a mini Windsor Castle to celebrate the coming royal wedding of British Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.
	The castle was built by 11 model makers out of 60,000 Lego pieces. Lego says the wedding scene model took a month to build.

It's #WeddingWednesday and what better way to celebrate than counting down the days until Harry & Meghan tie the knot. Lego experts have been very excited & spent 752 hours building Windsor castle. With only 237 hours to go, I'm sure they could build some Corgis! #royalwedding pic.twitter.com/eclP7tbAGD The wedding takes place on 19 May. eNCA
