PARLIAMENT – The Standing Committee on Finance on Tuesday said MPs have resolved to summon former Steinhoff CEO Markus Jooste to appear in Parliament in person to answer questions. That committee along with three others – the Standing Committee on Accounts (Scopa), the Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry and the Portfolio Committee on Public Service and Administration – made the decision after Jooste declined an invitation to appear before them. READ: Steinhoff losses may be $7.2bn more than anticipated The committees will now use section 14 of the Powers, Privileges and Immunities of Parliament Act and section 56 of the Constitution to try and force Jooste to appear to account for the financial irregularities at international retailer, Steinhoff during his tenure. The company suffered massive losses when the irregularities were revealed, having a major knock-on effect on many South Africans' pensions.

Mr Jooste will be required to give an evidence to the Committee on the collapse in value of the Steinhoff shares," the finance committee said in a statement. eNCA
