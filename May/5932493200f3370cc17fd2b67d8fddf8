CARDIFF â€“ Former Wales captain Gwyn Jones says the Test match against South Africa in Washington DC on Saturday is a "shambles" and "devalues international rugby". Speaking on Scrum V, a BBC Wales' television programme, Jones said he did not know why the game was organised. READ: Kolisi named Bok captain for England series "It was purely money-raising and trying to spread the word in America. It looks though it will be an absolute shambles. Test rugby against the Springboks should not be a stepping stone and should not be a preparation match." --------------------
		
		IT'S MATCHDAY IN LOS ANGELES#TogetherStronger #TheRedWall #MEXWAL #LA pic.twitter.com/Zn1wMlDsCZ Wales play the Springboks in the USA on Saturday without most of their British and Irish Lions players while South Africa have not chosen their best players. The Welsh are using the match as a warm-up because Warren Gatland's Wales are preparing to face Argentina in two Test matches, also next month. Similarly, the Springboks are preparing for three-Test series against England and have left many first choices behind in South Africa. BREAKING! Siya Kolisi has been appointed to captain the Springboks in the Castle Lager Incoming Series against England next month, while Pieter-Steph du Toit will lead the side against Wales in Washington. Both men will captain the Springboks for the first time. #LoveRugby pic.twitter.com/rcy3jPgnbt African News Agency
