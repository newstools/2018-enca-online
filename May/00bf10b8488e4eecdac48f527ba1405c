JOHANNESBURG - The DA is disputing claims its senior leaders are at loggerheads over white privilege comments made by party leader Mmusi Maimane. Speaking at a Freedom Day rally in Soshanguve in Pretoria, Maimane said white privilege and black poverty must be addressed. "My wife & I appeared to have started off in similar places, but in reality there was a difference.
		
		She was all but guaranteed Uni entrance, could start a business thanks to a network of people willing to assist
		
		For many white SAns this is the case." - @MmusiMaimane #FreedomDay pic.twitter.com/gbU07twD1V "Black South Africans aren’t poor because they are black.
		
		They are poor because they are still enslaved by a system that keeps them poor.
		
		A system that denies them their freedom every day." - @MmusiMaimane #FreedomDay https://t.co/DZ0OESYdwq Maimane said on Twitter that he stands by the comments he made. I firmly stand by comments I made on Freedom Day. SA remains deeply unequal, with black SAns locked out of opportunities. We must focus on solving the problem. Liberation of one race is not the enslaving of another - all of us, black & white, must come together to build #1SA4All The racists from all backgrounds will seek to https://t.co/s3dHlvLWuE still remains deeply unequal on the basis of race.I won’t pander to the racists, will work with All to ensure that SA belongs to all who live in it Black&White.Let’s dismantle our yesterday& build our tomorrow DA spokesperson Refiloe Ntsheka said the comments were taken out of context.
	
	"People wanted to understand the context of the comment. He explained the context and the leadership understood where he came from." She said the DA's leadership is united.
