JOHANNESBURG – North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo has promised to send a letter to the Speaker of the provincial legislature by Friday. While the premier provided no detail of what might be in that letter, it's believed the embattled Mahumapelo may have signalled that he will resign. Mahumapelo met with President Cyril Ramaphosa last week after the ANC recommended that he step down as Premier. The politically embattled North West premier may have reached the end of his political runway. READ: EFF walks out of Supra's budget speech During what may have been his last budget speech, Supra Mahumapelo was confronted by an EFF calling him an illegitimate Premier. Muhamapelo has been steadfast that ANC deployees must be allowed to finish their term of office. But he also made these cryptic remarks about a letter he will send to the Speaker at the end of this week. WATCH: Mahumapelo speaks about alleged plot to assassinate him “Madam Speaker I'm going to read a paragraph here and I request members to listen because it’s complicated..... The Speaker will receive on Friday in writing clarifying the essence of the absence of presence... we need for economic growth and job creation is achieved,” he said. When questioned about the content of the letter, Mahumapelo simply walked away without providing any further clarity. Adding fuel to the notion that this might have been Mahumapelo's last appearance as Premier in the North West legislature, his wife - who rarely attends budget votes - was spotted in the half-empty ANC benches. eNCA
