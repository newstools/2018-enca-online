JOHANNESBURG – Funerals may be one of the worst events for anyone to attend. However for a Tzaneen couple, Themba Mtsweni and his wife Hellen, it turned out to be part of their fairy tale, one that got Twitter detectives suggesting that "maybe" attending funerals is not as bad as they are thought to be. I'm 35 and i was about to throw in the towel, the bride is 37, I'm encouraged, I might start attending all the funerals around my area. #OurPerfectWedding The two were at a funeral in 2017, when Hellen caught Themba's eye. Themba aproached Hellen and asked for her contact digits, but Hellen refused. Somehow he managed to get her number the following day and arranged a meeting. The rest is history. They met last year at a funeral...when you know you know #OurPerfectWedding pic.twitter.com/HWhz4hqD1X In the space of less than a year, the couple have got married.
