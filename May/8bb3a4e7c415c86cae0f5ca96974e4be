JOHANNESBURG – The family of Katlego Joja, who was found floating in a river on Sunday, wants police officers who turned the family away fired. On Wednesday the community of Mamelodi marched in solidarity with the family to the police station demanding the badges of those officers who dismissed the Joja family when they reported the girl missing. The 10-year-old’s family members were turned away twice. “The family feels that if the reporting was done initially we could be feeding our child now, not burying her,” said Katlego's uncle Thabiso Storom. Police say the national instruction is that the 24-hour waiting policy doesn’t apply. Instead, police officers must prioritise cases like that of Joja, who was autistic.

There is a national instruction and there shouldn’t be a waiting period and that wasn’t done,” Gauteng police spokesperson Mathapelo Peters said. Social movement #NotInMyName also joined marchers calling for disciplinary measures against the officers. “We are glad disciplinary action is taken against officers who didn’t deal with the issues and we hope it’s going to serve as the lesson in the country,” said Themba Masango of the organisation. eNCA
