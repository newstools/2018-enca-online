JOHANNESBURG - Thousands of long and short distance bus commuters had their fingers crossed that striking bus workers will have good news for them. However, this was not the case on Friday. Unions participating in a crippling national bus strike were set to update the public and media on progress in wage negotiations on Friday afternoon. On Thursday, employers tabled a new wage offer. However, the issue of back pay is blocking the deal from being accepted. The start of the press briefing was, however, delayed, as unions said they are were awaiting a mandate from their members. Employers are now offering 9 percent for the first year, and 8 percent for the second year. It's been three weeks since bus drivers nationwide stopped working, demanding better pay.

CEO Francois Meyer said in a statement that Golden Arrow could not continue its practice of paying up to 59 percent more than the minimum rates agreed to with unions. The secretary-general of the South African Road Passenger Bargaining Council, Gary Wilson, has said he's frustrated at the continuing nationwide bus strike. eNCA
