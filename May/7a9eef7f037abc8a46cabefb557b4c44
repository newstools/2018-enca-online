The ANC in the Western Cape added its voice, saying: "We know Ashwin as a strong man who against all odds, pulled himself by the bootstraps out of poverty and out of a written fate for many of the young people who come from his neighbourhoods." The party went on to say: "As the ANC, we believe that Ashwin's public walkout is a result of what many black people experience in offices and boardrooms across the country, where being black is a constant source of being undermined, doubted, spoken down upon, and largely made to feel outside various social cliques and cores within the same working environment." eNCA
