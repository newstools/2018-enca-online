JOHANNESBURG - Supra Mahumapelo, North West's premier-on-leave, has a very strong sangoma, says political analyst and Unisa professor Lesiba Teffo. On Wednesday, the ANC in North West announced it had instructed Mahumapelo not to resign as planned, but rather to take leave. Mahumapelo then appointed North West MEC for Finance Wendy Nelson as acting premier -- even though she has been charged with fraud over a Gupta-linked mobile medical clinic scandal. Mahumapelo has also been charged in the case.

Teffo says what Norths West needs is a premier who is neutral, possibly from outside the province. A public policy specialist from the North West University, Kagiso Pooe, earlier told eNCA it is clear Mahumapelo is still in charge of North West. eNCA
