PARLIAMENT – The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) has cancelled the tender process to find a replacement for Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) to distribute social grants, News24 reported on Tuesday. That is according to papers filed in the Constitutional Court on Friday. The papers reportedly show the new acting CEO, Abraham Mahlangu scrapped the process to find the new service provider. READ: Shabangu vows not to extend Sassa CPS contract In March, the Constitutional Court granted a six-month extension to Sassa's contract with CPS, following a previous one-year extension to give the agency time to find an alternative because the original contract had been declared invalid. The Minister of Social Development Susan Shabangu will now reportedly set up a "technical committee" to find alternatives to the cash payment of grants.

Shabangu promises to comply with the ConCourt's September 2018 deadline to change service providers. The minister did not raise the matter of the cancelled tender during her appearance before Parliament's accountability watchdog Scopa on Tuesday. eNCA
