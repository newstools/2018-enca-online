CAPE TOWN - Ousted Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille told her supporters outside the Western Cape High Court where she is fighting for her political survival that the Democratic Alliance (DA) was not above the law. She spoke to supporters within the DA and many others from other opposition parties, including the African National Congress (ANC), Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and the United Democratic Movement (UDM) during lunchtime. De Lille's lawyers are making out a case in the high court where the former mayor is seeking to retain her post at least until May 25 when her legal challenge to the validity of her removal from office by the DA will be heard. She was removed from office on Tuesday after the DA federal executive confirmed the cessation of her membership of the party, effectively removing her from her post. "We are here because we are fighting for justice. We are here because we are all equal before the law. We are not here because I am above the party. The party is not above the law," she said. #DeLille says the Democratic Alliance is not above the law. pic.twitter.com/bQ2UpBO6E6 Earlier in court, her lawyers argued the DA and its federal bodies did not strictly comply with proper procedures and the rules of natural justice when it came to the decision to axe the veteran politician. Johan De Waal, for De Lille, told the court the clause in the DA Constitution relied upon to remove her was "vague, capable of being abused", and accordingly inconsistent with section 19 (3) of the South African Constitution.
