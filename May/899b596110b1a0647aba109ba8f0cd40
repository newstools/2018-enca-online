JOHANNESBURG - Meet Africa’s longest serving flight attendant. Marion Fernandes, 67, has worked up in the air for nearly five decades and she plans to keep flying until she turns 80. She plans to beat the current record-holder to become the longest serving flight attendant in the world. For Fernandes, it all started here at OR Tambo International Airport (then Jan Smuts) when she would see her father fly. “I used to see these really glamourous air hostesses…,” she said.
