PARLIAMENT – Minister of Social Development Susan Shabangu and acting CEO of the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) Abraham Mahlangu were grilled by MPs on Tuesday, over the social grants agency’s irregular expenditure amounting to a whopping R1.4-billion. While Shabangu promised to investigate the former CEO of Sassa Pearl Bhengu and other senior officials, they were not in Parliament to answer questions about the misuse of public funds reserved for the poorest of the poor.

Parliament hears that SASSA approved in one day in Dec last year a marquee R485 000, flooring, R482 000, decor R487 000 and gifts for VIPS of R480 000. All just under R500 000 which puts it out of rules for special urgent spending. @eNCA MPs heard about millions spent on VIP security for former Social Development minister Bathabile Dlamini's children and other staff who said they claimed in danger. #SASSA has still not recovered R2 million from Former minister Bathabile Dlamini which she used from SASSAs coffers to pay for security for her children. She said at time her children were at risk. #SCOPA @eNCA Parliamentarians called Sassa a “failed entity guilty of wholesale theft.” Shabangu sat with her head in her hands at times and promised to investigate senior staff members.
