JOHANNESBURG - Mandisa Mashego, the leader of the EFF caucus in the Gauteng legislature, was as polished as a longstanding news anchor when she hosted "As It Happens" on eNCA on Tuesday night. She said she agreed to guest host the show on the condition that the channel apologise for "humiliating" Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. Mashego interviewed DA Gauteng health spokesman Jack Bloom, challenging him on the EFF call for 24-hour clinics in Gauteng. Her commander-in-chief, Julius Malema cheered her on, referring to Bantu Holomisa's tongue-tied anchoring debut. WATCH: Did The People’s Bae slay on eNCA?
