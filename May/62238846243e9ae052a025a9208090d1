JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) says it is taking necessary measures to resolve issues in the North West Province. ANC national spokesperson Pule Mabe spoke to Vuyo Mvoko on Friday. "There will be a decision that moves the people of the North West forward. Unfortunately, what our structures and the members of society are supposed to do is to give the ANC the space, as requested, to make sure it moves to solve this,” Mabe said. “There are interventions taking place and we are moving with the necessary speed, I must say", the spokesperson added. eNCA
