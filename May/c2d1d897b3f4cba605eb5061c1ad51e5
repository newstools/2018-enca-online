JOHANNESBURG – The African National Congress (ANC) in the Free State on Sunday said its newly elected leadership enjoys the party's support. This despite delegates not having taken a vote at Saturday's provincial elective congress. Delegates failed to vote after delays with registration. But members were nominated and seconded for positions on Sunday. The ANC also quashed concerns that the separation of powers in province is at risk. Sam Mashinini has been nominated as the new chairperson of the African National Congress (ANC) in the Free State. William Bulwane was nominated as deputy chairperson and Paseka Nompondo as secretary.
