Google says it wants to help users get things done much quicker so they have more time to focus on life’s more important things. From now on your Google Assistant will be speaking on your behalf, literally. It will make calls and talk to the person on the other end to schedule appointments and book reservations for you.

The assistant will be able to answer questions, like, "What service are you looking for?" or "What time are you looking for?" It will even have verbal fillers like "ums" and "uhs" for a convincing impersonation of how a real human being speaks. The feature will be rolled out in the next few weeks as an experiment before being launched more permanently, with its abilities expanded to ordering food from restaurants.
