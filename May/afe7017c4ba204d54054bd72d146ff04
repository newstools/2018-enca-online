CAPE TOWN – The Western Cape government's decision to sell a prime piece of Cape Town land to a private school was unlawful and should be overturned, the ANC said on Sunday. ANC National Executive Committee member Ronald Lamola updated the media on the tussle between Cape Town land activists and the provincial government over the Tafelberg school site in Sea Point. In 2017, the national Human Settlements Department challenged the Western Cape government decision. "There is court action by the Department of Human Settlements. It does not make sense at all when there are clear laws. The government of the DA claims to be the custodians of the law. They have clearly violated the law," Lamola said.

"The court must take a decision and give back that school to the Department of Human Settlements to use it to assist domestic workers to take their children to that school, but also for some social housing." The property was sold for R135-million but the transfer has not taken place pending legal challenges. Housing activist group Ndifuna Ukwazi said the fight for affordable housing in Sea Point must be won. UPDATE: Chaos in Cape Town amid attempted 'land grab' "It's a very short-termist view to think 'okay we'll sell this asset now, to plug this gap now'. Once you've sold it, it's gone and the government will never ever be able to recoup it," said the group's Nick Budlender. The sale sparked protests that led to a year-long occupation of the deserted Helen Bowden Nurses Home in nearby Green Point. Lawyers working on the case say the Western Cape government submitted reams of legal documents last week and no date has yet been set for arguments. The provincial government previously argued that the Tafelberg sale was lawful and necessary to supplement revenue. eNCA
