JOHANNESBURG - Sibanye-Stillwater said on Tuesday it has received approval from the South African Reserve Bank for its acquisition of platinum producer Lonmin. In December, Sibanye-Stillwater agreed to buy the troubled miner for about £285-million (R4.8-billion) in an all-share deal. Neal Froneman, chief executive of Sibanye-Stillwater said the company was pleased to have received this important regulatory approval in a timely manner. "[It] takes us another step closer to concluding this important transaction. Management remains focused on ensuring that the remaining conditions are met and will notify stakeholders as further progress is made," he said.

It is subject to the passing of the required resolutions by Lonmin and Sibanye-Stillwater shareholders and the approvals of the competition authorities of the United Kingdom and South Africa. Lonmin had expressed concern on Monday that it might have to shed more than 12,600 jobs by 2020 if the deal was delayed. African News Agency
