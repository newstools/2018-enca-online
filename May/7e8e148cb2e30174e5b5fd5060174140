VUNDUZI, Mozambique – Locals in Vunduzi, a village near the place where Mozambican soldiers and former Renamo rebels fought their last battle, fear that Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama's death this month could spell fresh unrest. Sitting at the foot of the Gorongosa mountains in central Mozambique, Vunduzi was a ghost village two years ago with a handful of stalls basically serving government troops deployed there. At the slightest sound of gunshot, villagers would rush into the thick forest to hide. At night they slept in the forest to avoid government soldiers or spies locally known as the "death squad" who were blamed for kidnapping and murdering supporters of the Mozambique National Resistance or Renamo. OPINION: Renamo leader's death a 'game changer' for Mozambique peace process But after Dhlakama unilaterally decreed a truce at the end of 2016, life returned to normal. Military checkpoints disappeared and cars, trucks and motorcycles moved around freely in the village. The main school, which had been shut in 2015, reopened. Public buildings have been repainted and the village now has electricity. Dhlakama's sudden death on May 3 in his Gorongosa bush camp has left the small village shaken and worried about the future. Months earlier, Dhlakama and Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi had opened direct peace negotiations to end the fighting that had resumed in 2013.

The 16-year war devastated the economy and left one million people dead. He later then transformed Renamo into a political party which has participated in elections since the first multi-party democratic vote in October 1994. AFP
