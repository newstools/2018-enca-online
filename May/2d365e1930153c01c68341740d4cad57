Back to school night Comin soon A post shared by  snoopdogg (@snoopdogg) on JOHANNESBURG – American rapper Snoop Dogg had something to say about Bantu Holomisa's anchoring skills. The rapper posted on his Instagram's page the viral video of Holomisa's stint on eNCA. @BantuHolomisa my General, you see now pic.twitter.com/BeT5Qb0QmP WATCH: Was Holomisa's news anchoring debut happening or hollow? The leader of the United Democratic Movement presented As It Happens and discovered that anchoring is harder than it looks and got off to a slightly rocky start with an awkward pause or two but soon managed to overcome the hiccup. Truth be told the TelePrompt Screen messed me up and caught me unaware. I will catch that fish in future. Thanks for watching. So the technical gremlins made life a little tricky for @BantuHolomisa as he hosted #AsItHappens on #eNCA. Autocue decided to combine all the words - it happens - thank you General for joining us and being a great sport! @tonyndoro and @MichelleL_Craig know how it feels ---- pic.twitter.com/xcbDhmcoEw eNCA
