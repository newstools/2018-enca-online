JOHANNESBURG - The National Lotteries Commission has given millions to South Africa's Olympic body, Sascoc, over the years as part of its mandate.

Sascoc held a breakfast to thank the National Lotteries Commission for its years of support. Part of its R70-million contribution in 2016 helped Sascoc fund the Rio Olympics campaign. While the haul from Brazil was welcomed, Lotto chairperson Alfred Nevhutanda has challenged the sports organisation to aim higher. *Watch the video above for the full story eNCA
