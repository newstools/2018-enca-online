PARIS - Roger Federer announced on Wednesday that he will start his grass-court season at the ATP tournament in Stuttgart in June, after skipping the clay-court swing.

The Swiss is currently second in the world rankings behind Rafael Nadal, but depending on his long-term rival's results on clay over the next six weeks, could arrive in Germany as the world number one.
