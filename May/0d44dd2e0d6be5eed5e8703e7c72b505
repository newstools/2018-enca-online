JOHANNESBURG - It seems Barcelona are taking the match against Mamelodi Sundowns seriously, despite the timing of the fixture. Star player Lionel Messi has been rested ahead of the trip to South Africa. Without him, the Blaugrana lost away to Levante, a result which ended their unbeaten run in La Liga. READ: A history of FC Barcelona Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane said: “If you look at the match and if you look at the result, you look at the goals you understand that this team [Barca] scores goals, they scored four goals yesterday. You look at the previous match they won 5 – 1, you look at the previous match, they drew 2-2... You look at the other one, they won 2 – 1 against Valencia. “They are forever a big team, they are forever a team that scores goals, so you’ve got to respect that,” he added. eNCA
