JOHANNESBURG - The ANC  provincial executive council (PEC) in North West has made it clear that its embattled leader, Supra Mahumapelo, is going nowhere. On Tuesday, the ANC in North West had released a statement welcoming his exit. Mahumapelo had said he would resign by midday on Wednesday. But on Wednesday he said the ANC would have to ask him to leave. WATCH: I await PEC to ask me to resign, says Supra Mahumapelo In a press conference on Wednesday, the PEC said it had instructed Mahumapelo to withdraw his resignation. Mahumapelo's about-turn on his resignation has been described as the last kicks of a dying horse. According to political analyst Theo Venter: "The [ANC] provincial executive has no say. What makes this more of a joke (is that) three of the regions are interim structures ... he appointed them, he chairs the meeting." Venter believes the ANC "will definitely act against the leadership of Mahumapelo." North West has been rocked by violent protests, with residents calling for Mahumapelo to resign. However, on Wednesday, Mahumapelo’s supporters stormed a meeting of the ANC PEC. On Wednesday afternoon, Mahumapelo addressed his supporters after the PEC meeting. Mahumapelo says he's heading to court. #SupraMahumapelo https://t.co/SOEZ3D6YwH A public policy specialist from the North West University, Kagiso Pooe says Mahumapelo is still in charge in North West. According to Pooe, Mahumapelo should have fixed the problems plaguing the province instead of just mentioning them. eNCA
