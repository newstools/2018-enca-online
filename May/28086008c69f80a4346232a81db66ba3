JOHANNESBURG – The World Health Organisation (WHO) said it is awaiting formal approval from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to send in unlicensed Ebola medication to help rein in an outbreak of the deadly virus. WHO’s request comes as the DRC authorities rush to contain the outbreak that has killed 25 and infected 54 other people in recent weeks. The #Ebola vaccine is an additional tool that gives us new hope to stop the outbreak more quickly.

Salama said all of the drugs were as yet “unregistered.” Because of this, they can only be used under the protocols used for research and clinical trials, which also requires ethical reviews and informed consent from each recipient, he said. “But the government is very keen to begin using them and we expect to formally get approval and start within the coming days,” he added.

This way, there would be “more information in the future outbreaks on which drugs could be most effective.” African News Agency
