KOSTER - A service delivery protest in the Kgetlengrivier Local Municipality has caused the mayor to flee the area. Residents went on the rampage, destroying private property belonging to the mayor on Wednesday afternoon. Roads where blockaded as well, bringing the local town of Koster to a standstill. Kgetlengrivier Local Municipality Mayor Kim Medupe stood by as her home and business was gutted by a fire. Medupe says this is no ordinary community protest. “It’s not a surprise that the community torched my property in Koster, mainly because there were a number of events that were unfolding prior to what happened yesterday,” Medupe said. “I am clearly saying that this was a political move...” READ: KZN Mayor in the dock for Speaker murder plot The politically-embattled mayor also says she cannot dismiss that this incident may be linked to former North West premier Supra Mahumapelo. Medupe claims her properties were targetted immediately after the visit of the ANC Chairperson in her area. “I may not personally say he is linked but this has unfolded immediately after the visit,” she said. Private vehicles and trucks belonging to local businessmen were also torched.

He maintained the torching were due to allegations of bad service delivery. The mayor said the incident was a sign of a political battle inside her own organisation, the ANC. Medupe also refutes all allegations she may have benefitted from corruption. eNCA
