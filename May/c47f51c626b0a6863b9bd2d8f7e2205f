To stand a chance to win one of ten gifts valued at R15 000, the schools had to submit Good Breakfast Diaries that were completed by the learners. Teachers also had to send photo and video report information to show how they completed the Programme each week in the classroom. The cash prizes will be used to purchase kitchen equipment to ensure the learners receive a nutritious breakfast every day at school, so that they can improve their concentration and overall performance. All participating schools were also rewarded with a fridge for their kitchens. â€œWe are very pleased with the way that the schools and teachers have gotten behind the programme and have really committed their time and energy to make it work. This is why we felt the need to reward those schools who really went the extra mile to ensure the lessons were really valuable to the learners, said Sasha Sathianathan, Rama Social Mission Brand Manager, Unilever South Africa. In 2017, Unilever commissioned a scientific white paper seeking to clarify the value of habitually eating a nutritious breakfast, in relation to the growth and development of children in South Africa. Studies compiled in the scientific white paper, revealed that school age children who regularly skip breakfast are less likely to concentrate in class, thus affecting school performance.
