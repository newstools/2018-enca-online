He says the adoption of new regulations for female classification is based on the same ideology that’s led to some of the worst atrocities in history. My colleague Steve Cornelius shows why integrity and fairness cannot serve anachronistic and prejudicial ideas in self-regulation. #IAAF #Semenya #sportslaw pic.twitter.com/1ngchAyY1e Cornelius believes the regulations will probably be unlawful in parts of the world. History will judge the IAAF council harshly, he says. Cornelius believes an injustice has been perpetrated against certain female athletes. Many critics of the new regulations say they are aimed at curbing the performance of star athlete Caster Semenya. #ChooseDay pic.twitter.com/wejUzWs23f eNCA
