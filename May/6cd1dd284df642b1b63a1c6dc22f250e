PRETORIA - The government is investigating a Pretoria old-age home for alleged mistreatment. Residents of the Lodewyk Spies Home in the east of the capital say they're not being given enough to eat, and that they've been without toiletries for over two months. But the home's manager denies the allegations and blames the Social Development Department for late subsidy payments. The department concedes that grant payments to this home and scores of other NGOs across the province were delayed due to a strike in the department. But it doubts this could have led to the situation described by residents and staff members. The department says it will escalate its probe into the home and its finances. * eNCA's Lirandzu Themba filed this report. eNCA
