JOHANNESBURG – Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi says despite a stringent increase in tobacco laws, producers always find loopholes. Thursday marked World No Tobacco Day. Officials want to ban smoking inside public buildings and introduce a 10-metre ban outdoors.

For instance, when the anti-smoking legislation was passed, there were no e-cigarettes. Now they came up with e-cigarettes, which are supposed to be, according to them, not delivering nicotine but we know most of them do,” Motsoaledi said. “We discovered that young people start smoking through e-cigarettes...as part of the new legislation... we are also including e-cigarettes as a cigarette. We have discovered a gap where --- on cigarette packets, it's written not to be sold to under 18s. But there are vending machines all over that don't recognise age just money so we are going to ban vending machines all over.” eNCA
