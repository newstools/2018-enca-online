NAIROBI - Kenya’s public university lecturers have ended a strike over low pay after reaching an agreement with authorities, a union official said, allowing classes to resume after being suspended since early March. Strikes by public workers in the East African country have become more frequent in recent years, often over low pay and other grievances.

Some public workers accuse the government of President Uhuru Kenyatta of neglecting them and failing to curb widespread corruption that they say swallows money that could be used to raise their pay. Government officials deny the accusation. Reuters
