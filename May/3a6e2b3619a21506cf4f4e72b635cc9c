JOHANNESBURG – Students should never be quiet when their lovers abuse them. This was the message at the funeral of slain Mangosuthu University of Technology student Zolile Khumalo. Khumalo was shot and killed allegedly by her ex-boyfriend Thabani Mzolo at the institution’s Lonsdale residence in Durban last week. The university says over ten women students have since reported their alleged abuse. Most were fellow students from Mangosuthu. Mzolo apparently admitted on his Facebook page that he had shot Zolile. Students say they no longer feel safe at their residences.

Student representatives have appealed to varsity management to tighten up security even at the off-campus residence. They also called on all students especially women to report incidents of abuse by their lovers. “What we have learned the most about this is that there are so many women who are being abused by males and they only now starting to come out to say I don’t want what happened to Zolile to happen to me, now they are coming out say I have so and so who has been abusing me for such a long time and such incidents are being taken very seriously,” said SRC president Sandile Dlamini. University management has committed to improving security at their residences.
