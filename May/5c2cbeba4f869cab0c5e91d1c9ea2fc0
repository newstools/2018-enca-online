JOHANNESBURG – The Democratic Alliance is confident that Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor Athol Trollip is going nowhere as opposition parties plot their way forward after abandoning another motion of no confidence. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) withdrew its motion on Thursday after acknowledging it didn't have the necessary number of votes. This is now the third recent failed attempt to remove Trollip. “Politics is a game of numbers and we are not going to waste our motion of no confidence like that. So we thought: let’s withhold it for just a brief moment of time - but we will pursue it,” said EFF councillor in the metro Zilindile Vena.

We're talking to different parties to work with us... We're doing very well in becoming a good government and we're getting support on the ground from the people," Banga continued. For now, the opposition parties say they will regroup to strategise on their next move. eNCA
