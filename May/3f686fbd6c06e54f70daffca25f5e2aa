CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape High Court will on Tuesday deliver its verdict on the future of former Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille. De Lille, recently stripped of her party membership, took the Democratic Alliance (DA) to court over the move. She is also fighting to be reinstated as Cape Town mayor. WATCH: DA rescinds De Lille's party membership De Lille is further questioning the constitutionality of the clause used to oust her, arguing the decision lies with the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) and not with her party. The City of Cape in a statement said judgment would be delivered at 1:15pm on Tuesday. READ: Neilson to appoint mayoral committee, says no one can stop him Earlier, acting Cape Town mayor Ian Neilson said he would appoint a new mayoral committee on Monday afternoon and that nobody would stop him. He said he was required to appoint a committee and that not even a court challenge could stop him. But the latest statement appears to backtrack on Neilsonâ€™s previous statement. A new mayoral committee will now be announced at some point after the judgment, the statement said, without specifying a date. eNCA
