SOWETO – Orlando Pirates signed off their Premiership campaign with a 2-1 home win over Free State Stars at Orlando Stadium on Saturday afternoon. Though the result was of no consequence to the Buccaneers – who were set to finish runners-up regardless – they will be pleased by ending their campaign on a positive note. Ea Lla Koto, meanwhile, have bigger fish to fry when they face Maritzburg United in next weekend’s Nedbank Cup final.

Sadly for the Bucs goal-scorer he succumbed to a thigh injury just over 10 minutes later and was replaced by Gladwin Shitolo. But even with the disruption in their defence, Pirates were able to see out the half and take a 1-0 lead into the break.

The visitors looked to claim the lead for the first time on 63 minutes, with Goodman Dlamini shooting on target from long range, but Sandilands scrambled across his line to palm the ball away for a corner kick. The Bucs reclaimed the ascendancy in the 85th minute as Justin Shonga’s long-range shot was only half-stopped by substitute goalkeeper Badra Ali Sangare, allowing Thamsanqa Gabuza to turn home the loose ball from close range to make it 2-1.
