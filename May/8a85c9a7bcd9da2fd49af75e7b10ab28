JOHANNESBURG - Holding company Famous Brands said on Wednesday its revenue increased by 23 percent to R7-billion but headline earnings per share fell eight percent to 393 cents in the year ended February 28. The company, whose brands include food companies Steers, Wimpy, Debonairs Pizza and Fishaways, among others, said challenging trading conditions persisted in the year under review. Common to all its markets in South Africa, the rest of the continent, the Middle East and the United Kingdom, the industry featured a highly competitive landscape, limited discretionary spend and subdued consumer sentiment. "Consistent with this environment, consumers’ scrutiny of value intensified, resulting in aggressive pricing pressure among competitors and further margin squeeze," Famous Brands said. "In general, muted like-for-like sales growth was reported by the industry across our trading territories." Following the acquisition of a number of businesses in the 2017 financial year, undertaken to meet robust growth targets, the group’s gearing was substantially higher than in prior years. The board had resolved not to declare a dividend for the period under review. "Trading conditions are expected to remain challenging. Intense competition will remain a key feature, while sustained demand from consumers for value will continue to squeeze margins," it said. African News Agency
