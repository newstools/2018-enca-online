CARACAS - Venezuela has released 11 directors of the country's leading private bank who had been held on suspicion of speculative attacks on the local currency, the country's top prosecutor said Wednesday. "Conditional liberties have been granted in the middle of the investigation," prosecutor Tarek William Saab told Venezuelan private TV Globovision. He said all the Banesco bank president and 10 directors are free "with restrictive measures in place, but obviously the investigation is continuing." The Banesco executives were arrested last week on suspicion of facilitating or covering up "attacks" on Venezuela's currency, the bolivar, through the movement of currency abroad and dollar speculation on the black market. Caracas later announced it would step in to run the bank for a period of 90 days to halt illegal activity. The government of embattled President Nicolas Maduro has blamed criminal networks for the meltdown of the bolivar through fixing the rate of the "black dollar," which trades 12 times higher than the central bank's rate, but which is not accessible to Venezuelan citizens or companies. The bolivar's plummeting value has sent inflation soaring. Last month the IMF said that massive hyperinflation was likely to see prices surging 13,000 percent this year. AFP
