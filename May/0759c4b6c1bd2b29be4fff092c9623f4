DURBAN - President Cyril Ramaphosa has condemned ongoing political killings in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). On Monday, he visited the home of late African National Congress (ANC) official Musawenkosi Mchunu, who was gunned down in Pietermaritzburg on Friday. READ: More political killings in KwaZulu-Natal “We’re here again, comrades, because the number of people killed in the province has risen. Down with killings by our own comrades," Ramaphosa urged. “The killing of our people should stop. Comrade Mchunu is the 14th comrade to be killed in this region. We don’t want any more killings, that’s why we’re here. In the past weeks, comrade Cele was killed on the South Coast together with an Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) member. “There’s people who don’t want peace and who want to turn the area into a killing field. We will not allow KZN to be the killing field of South Africa,” Ramaphosa added. eNCA
