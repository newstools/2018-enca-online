JOHANNESBURG – Steel company ArcelorMittal South Africa said on Friday domestic demand remained weak in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period last year, while volatility in the rand/US dollar exchange rate impacted the business significantly. The company said local sales were down two percent during the quarter versus last year, mainly due to lower local demand for flat products as a result of low economic activity in South Africa, but export sales jumped 33 percent. Liquid steel production was 71,000 tonnes or 5.9 percent higher, mainly due to increased output at both its Vanderbijlpark and Saldanha works, although this was partly offset by lower production at long products following some instability in the iron making process.

Total imports of primary steel products decreased by 20 percent in the first quarter compared to Q1 2017 as a result of safeguards, a weaker local market, high stock levels and increased production. "Despite this, imports of galvanised products increased by 14 percent, while total imports of products containing steel for the period increased by eight percent... mainly driven by imports of low standard thin gauge products which are not produced locally," ArcelorMittal SA said.

"Local sales will continue to be under pressure due to tough trading conditions, but we expect that flat product volumes will increase following the potential upside from renewable energy and other projects," the company said. "Export sales will also be higher due to better international prices." African News Agency
