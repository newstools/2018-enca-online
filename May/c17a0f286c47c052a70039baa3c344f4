PARIS - Air France-KLM’s board will decide on a management transition plan on 15 May, the company said on Saturday, after CEO Jean-Marc Janaillac said he would step down when staff at its French brand rejected a pay deal.

Strikes over the pay dispute, due to resume on 7 May and 8 May, have cost the company 300 million euros so far. Janaillac, who is the chairperson at Air France as well as the chair and CEO of parent group Air France-KLM, agreed to stay on until a 15 May shareholder meeting, the company said in a statement. Air France-KLM’s board will also meet then. Reuters
