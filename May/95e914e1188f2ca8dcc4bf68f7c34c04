JOHANNESBURG – National Police Commissioner Khehla Sitole says police officers must not die with their guns in their hands. He was speaking at the funeral of Meadowlands station commander Malefetsana Mofokeng on Saturday. READ: 'Nobody should kill police, go home and sleep peacefully': Cele Mofokeng was shot at his home in Protea South, Soweto on May 16. He was held up in his driveway shortly after arriving at his house by unknown suspects, who demanded his gun. His 14-year-old daughter was with him at the time. “As we continue to fight and make the legacy of the Brigadier live, let us not die with our guns and finally, our greatest glory is not never falling but in rising each time we fall. We accept the pain and we will rise again and make sure that the family of the Brigadier is never alone,” Sitole said. Mofokeng had worked for the SAPS for 37 years.

The war has been declared, ours is to fight it. You don’t go to the war and you hear guns going... and you ask what’s happening, you don’t ask what’s happening you join. Let’s join this war. Whoever declared this war must go back and say to himself or herself I did a mistake,” the minister said. eNCA
