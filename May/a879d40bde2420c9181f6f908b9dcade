JOHANNESBURG – Consumers could see an increase in their medical aid premiums if proposed changes to the Medical Schemes Amendment Bill go through. Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi is proposing new rules and prices for medical aid schemes. He wants to replace prescribed minimum benefits (PMB) with something called basic benefits, thereby prohibiting co-payments. But what does this actually mean for you and your pocket?

The medical schemes have co-payments so that they can manage the risk of the pool,” GTC’s head of healthcare Jill Larkan said. “So medical schemes have calculated that so many people will have an event where we can ask them to make a co-payment towards. The minister is actually saying that we would like no co-payments for PMB payments… This will put strain on medical aid schemes who will need to make adjustments to their plans. It is going to cost us all who belong to medical schemes, if you’re privileged enough to have a medical scheme.” Under the plan, uniform tariffs would be introduced. Currently, each medical scheme negotiates its own rates with service providers such as hospitals and doctors.
