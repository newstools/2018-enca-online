As much as we as professional workers are trying to ensure that kids are safe out there, it is not safe for kids to see those things because that is where they see things that they are not taught at home.

We must teach our kids that confidence is what is going to take you far. You don't have to undress and be naked. You don't have to be naked,” Maruge added. eNCA
