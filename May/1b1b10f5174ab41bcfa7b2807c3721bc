JOHANNESBURG – Shoprite Holdings on Wednesday apologised for a contentious Mother's Day "display" that it said was photographed out of context. Earlier, Africa’s largest supermarket chain was left with egg on its face after a store seemingly advertised home cleaning products as possible gifts for Mother's Day. A picture was circulated on similar media of a display labeled “Gifts to wow mom” which contained dishwashing, bleaching, and furniture cleaning products. According to Checkers, the incident happened at Checkers Van Der Lingen in Paarl. The supermarket said the merchandise was in the process of being moved from the back to the front of the store. “The Mother’s Day photo circulating on social media was taken at the Checkers Van Der Lingen store in Paarl on Friday, 4 May 2018, while the store was moving a Mother’s Day display from the back to the front of the store ahead of Mother’s Day this Sunday,” Checkers said in a statement. “We understand how the original photo could be misconstrued and for that we apologise. The photo was taken in the process of the display being moved. It was never our intention to put up a Mother’s Day display consisting of cleaning products. “Checkers would like to wish all a happy Mother’s Day,” the statement said.
