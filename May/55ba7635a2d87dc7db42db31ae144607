JOHANNESBURG – Talks are underway on the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast after a land invasion on a prestigious estate in Umhlali at the weekend. A large group demarcated plots on privately owned land, claiming it was under the instruction of the chief in the area. However, eNCA discovered the invasion was coordinated by a local man. The traditional council is now distancing itself from the land grab. A good spot at the upmarket estate could set one back a few million rand, but one of the plots is being sold for a mere R50. The undeveloped land is owned by the estate. Other privately owned areas were also targeted. “They were just going past our house and they were just choosing their place and then carrying on whatever they did," one owner told eNCA. Some residents say the group could have been a thousand-strong. When eNCA visited the home of the man believed to be behind the land occupation, it was told he was not ready to be interviewed yet. The KwaDukuza Municipality is facilitating talks between residents and those now claiming the land.

I think people might claim to mix the two." He said the municipality must help the landowners open charges against the invaders. Police and security forces have since been on site at the estate. eNCA
