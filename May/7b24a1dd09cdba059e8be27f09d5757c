JOHANNESBURG – A new app is hoping to remove the hassle of securing a table at your favourite restaurant. Dineplan allows users to make reservations in real time, while making it easier for restaurant owners to manage bookings. READ: App to help taxi users launched The creators of the app hope it will help the sector become more efficient. “There’s a lot of management when it comes to reservations - taking down the correct contact details when taking reservations, table management, guests,” said Dineplan director Greg Whitfield. “So it allows the restaurant to provide a much higher level of customer service. “They get to know who their customers are. And just makes sure that the entire process from the booking to the guest paying their bill is a good one.” READ: Hackers steal data from millions of users using restaurant app Zomato From Mugg-and-Bean and Spur to fine dining outlets like The Test Kitchen, the app lists all relevant information about a variety of restaurants on a single platform.
