JOHANNESBURG - Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe said on Thursday his department plans to finalise the revamped mining charter by the end of next month. "We aim to finalise and gazette the mining charter in June, having taken onboard inputs and concerns from stakeholders across the country," Mantashe said at an annual general meeting of mining executives. "The ministry expects the tight deadlines to be met, because bringing finality to these processes is key in entrenching regulatory and policy certainty, which is necessary for investment, thereby attainment of sustainable growth, development and transformation in the sector and society." READ: Zuma backs Zwane on new Mining Charter Mantashe said he was pleased that Parliament voted last week in favour of amendments to the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Amendment Bill ofÂ  2013. Parliament's committee on land and mineral resources would finalise the mandates and make recommendations to the National Assembly for further processing of the bill, he added. The third iteration of the charter was gazetted by Mantashe's predecessor, Mosebenzi Zwane, in June 2017, but was rejected by the Chamber of Mines, which went to court to have it set aside. One of the first actions President Cyril Ramaphosa took after his inauguration was to convince chamber representatives to halt the legal action and re-enter talks on a new charter. African News Agency
