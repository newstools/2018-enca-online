READ: North West protests reportedly shut Potchefstroom Hospital Residents who were to have appeared in the Athlone Magistrate's Court had not done so by lunchtime. Only about 17 residents were charged for public violence. “Now I've been inside I found that it's only 17 that are ready to appear,” said Lundi Silolo, a community leader. “The other 13 are still in Philippi court waiting to be charged. That's why there is a delay. But they said we must calm down. “We don't know what's happening. They said by 2pm we'll be okay and these guys left by Philippi police station will be here by 2pm," he said. AFP
