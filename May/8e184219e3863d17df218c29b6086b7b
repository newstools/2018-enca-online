RICHARDS BAY - Higher Education Minister Naledi Pandor is cracking the whip at the University of Zululand. She’s intervening after an advocacy group made allegations of widespread corruption, mismanagement and fraud. The University of Zululand has been at the centre of several scandals in the past few years ranging from corruption to financial mismanagement and even the selling of degrees. A concerned group called Save UniZulu has repeatedly demanded national intervention.

"The university is not by any means heading for bankruptcy or close to it. We, of course, would be the first to be concerned should there be such a situation. So all I would say is please ignore mistruths and let’s establish what the facts are,” says Pandor And that’s what she says closed meetings are for - a chance to allow her to establish the facts. But Save UniZulu says the solution is pretty obvious.

Parliament has also said the University of Zululand is corrupted, it has maladministration, yet nothing is being done. And we are saying that at the University of Zululand nothing is moving her [Pandor], because there are too many tenders held by high-ranking officials. "So our message to the minister is: Put this place into administration, do a full investigation, and those that are found to be guilty must be held accountable.” Pandor is expected to report a way forward soon. eNCA
