BRESCIA, Italy - South African Richard Sterne birdied his last three holes to join Englishmen Robert Rock and Laurie Canter two shots clear after the first round of the Italian Open in Brescia on Thursday. Sterne, one of the last players out on the first day, played the back nine first and shot six birdies and a bogey on the way home on the par-71 course on the banks of Lake Garda. Canter did not miss par and made an eagle at the par-5 seventh. Rock also eagled the seventh and made seven birdies with just one bogey. The 41-year-old Rock, a former Italian Open winner, is chasing his third career  victory. At 29, Canter, a late replacement in the tournament, has never finished higher than 14th on the European tour. The trio were followed by an impressive group of eight on six under, which included a revived Danny Willett. Willett, who hasn't won a tournament since capturing the 2016 Masters and  has slumped to 462nd in the world, carded his best round of the year. "It's been a while," he said after only his second round in the 60s this season. "We played really well and got the ball in play a lot." Willett teamed up with three of Italy's Paralympic golfers in the pre-tournament pro-am and said: "It was one of those days that just puts life into perspective when you see what this games does to bring people together. "We golfers don't know how lucky we are sometimes and to have the experience I did in the pro-am was one of those days where you step back, realise how fortunate we are." AFP
