JOHANNESBURG – President Cyril Ramaphosa says South Africa will use its position on the UN Security Council to unify the continent. He was speaking at Africa Day celebrations in Pretoria. “We are humbled by the endorsement that we as SA have received from the AU to serve in the UN security council for the period 2019-2020.
