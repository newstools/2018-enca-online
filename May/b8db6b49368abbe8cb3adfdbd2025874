JOHANNESBURG – Health workers' union Hospersa has slammed North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo for the worsening crisis in the province's health sector. The union says his resignation would have gone some way to resolving the worsening crisis in provincial health facilities. Last month, a group of doctors said patients were suffering because of the ongoing strike by health workers. The government has placed the North West health department under administration. The union has warned the situation could deteriorate. "I think the results will be more disastrous than Esidimeni,"  said spokesperson Kevin Halama, referring to the deaths of psychiatric patients at unlicensed NGOs in Gauteng.
