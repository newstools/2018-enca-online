"On the outset we need to condemn any intimidation... since the report surfaced, we have dispatched a high level team. When these threats were allegedly made, the mayor was out of town," said Nomus Dube-Ncube, KZN Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC. The Auditor-General (AG)’s office has since withdrawn its team from the eThekwini Municipality over safety concerns. eNCA
