The man allegedly raped the women, stabbed one with a pair of scissors and robbed both of their cellphones. He allegedly forced the students to take a computer and monitor, which they had to carry until they were outside the building. The attacker ordered the women to pass the loot to him before he jumped a gate and fled, police said at the time.
