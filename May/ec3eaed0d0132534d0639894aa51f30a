JOHANNESBURG - South Africa’s Kevin Anderson reached a new career-high ranking of seventh in the ATP singles rankings released on Monday. The 31-year-old first reached his previous best of No 8 in the world on 26 February and moved up one spot to break new ground. “A new career-high ranking today! Going to keep working hard for more,” said Anderson. “Big thanks to my team and to all the fans for your continued support.” Austrian Dominic Thiem beat Anderson for the first time to reach the Madrid Open final for the second successive year on Saturday. Anderson’s run to the semifinal, however, was enough to ensure he moved up in the singles rankings.
