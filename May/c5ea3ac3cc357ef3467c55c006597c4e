CAPE TOWN – Ousted Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille will go to court on Friday to challenge the DA’s decision to rescind her party membership. De Lille held a press briefing on Tuesday morning, just hours after the DA told journalists its federal executive had made the decision to oust her. WATCH: DA rescinds De Lille's party membership De Lille said she will show that the “automatic succession clause (used by the DA) is undemocratic and unconstitutional” and said she is still the mayor of the city because of the legal challenge. “As I sit here today, I have not been found guilty of anything,” she told journalists. She accused the DA of using shortcuts to get rid of her. “I will never succumb to their bullying. Why was it so hard for the DA to run the charges against me in an open process? The whole process can be concluded in a matter of weeks. “I will return to court and as I speak, my lawyers will then send it on. This so-called automatic cessation clause is unconstitutional and is unfairly applied to me. My only aim was to clear my name and I was not married to any position." She said some in the DA was against her push for transformation. De Lille will also lay charges of crimen injuria with police on Tuesday afternoon. This after two DA MPs shared a fake report, which stated that the Auditor-General had implicated her in wrongdoing. De Lille said she will reveal her future plans once she has cleared her name. "They've smeared my name in public and therefore I need to clear my name in public." She also said she will be writing a book on the saga. De Lille said she will go back to her office on Tuesday afternoon to meet with the deputy mayor and city manager to inform them of her decision. eNCA
