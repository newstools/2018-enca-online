LONDON - Aston Villa and Fulham will be playing for a minimum 160 million pounds (R269-billion) when they go head-to-head for a place in the Premier League at Wembley Stadium on Saturday in a match often described as the richest in world soccer. According to Deloitte Sports Business Group, the winner of the Championship playoff final for the third promotion place can finish bottom of the top-flight next season and still benefit from lucrative broadcasting deals and parachute payments.

Fulham can expect to earn up to 170 million pounds over three seasons if they are relegated from the Premier League after just one season. That breaks down to a minimum of 95 million pounds, mostly from Premier League's central payments, and approximately 75 million pounds in parachute payments in 2019-20 and 2020-21. Villa were relegated from the top division in 2016 and would receive a third parachute payment next year. However, they will need to forego that amount should they get promoted, meaning their minimum net uplift would be 160 million pounds. The change from three to two years of parachute payments was enforced from the 2016-17 season. This means that any club that gets relegated after just one season in the Premier League is only entitled to two years of parachute payments.

"The value of rights for the next cycle should reach current levels after the conclusion of the Premier League's sale of domestic rights (two smaller packages remain unsold) and international rights."
