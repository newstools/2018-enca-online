PARIS - A rare series of sketches of Japanese manga artist Osamu Tezuka's robot character Astro Boy sold for a record 269,400 euros (R3.36-million) in an auction in Paris Saturday. "It's a world record for this artist whose works are few in the market," said Eric Leroy, an expert on comic strips at the auction house Artcurial. The winning bid was five times the pre-sale estimate and Leroy put this down to "the rarity and exceptional character" of the China ink and watercolour strip measuring 35 centimetres by 25 centimetres. It was drawn at the end of the 1950s and comprises six panels showing Astro Boy fighting an enemy.

"Astro Boy is an emblematic work that has nursed a whole generation of collectors," Leroy said. Astro Boy was serialised in Japan from 1952 to 1968, It centred around an android with human emotions that is sold to a robot circus but saved from servitude by a professor who creates a robotic family for him.
