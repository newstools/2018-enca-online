JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa on Tuesday appointed Azhar Bham SC to preside over the disciplinary inquiry into SARS Commissioner Tom Moyane. Moyane had objected to the initial appointee, Judge Kate O’Regan, as she is linked to Corruption Watch, which has been highly critical of the commissioner.

President Ramaphosa thanked Judge O’Regan for availing herself for public service. Bham is an advocate with the prestigious Victoria Mxenge Group of Advocates, named after the human rights lawyer and activist who was murdered by the apartheid state four years after her husband Griffiths had met the same fate. eNCA
