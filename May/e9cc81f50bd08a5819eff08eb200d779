JOHANNESBURG - A 26-year-old police constable was wounded when a vehicle he and a colleague were travelling in came under attack in Sekhukhune in Limpopo, police said on Tuesday. Spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the two officers were on their way to attend to a complaint at a local mine on Monday night when they were attacked. ''As the members approached the speed hump, a Toyota Etios came speeding from behind and overtook them. The members turned the blue lights on, wanting to stop the Toyota. The vehicle suddenly stopped and two rifle-wielding suspects jumped out and started spraying the police vehicle with bullets, concentrating on the occupants. "The constable was hit on the side of the head and was taken to hospital, the other member was not injured.'' He said the assailants were believed to be the ones terrorising residents in Burgersfort, Jane Furse and Groblersdal. No arrests have been made. A case of attempted murder and malicious damage to property is being investigated. African News Agency
