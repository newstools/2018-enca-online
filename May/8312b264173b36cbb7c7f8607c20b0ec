"It is alleged that a group of community members went on (the) rampage and torched this building before running away.

The police are currently on the hunt for more suspects who also include ringleaders," Ngoepe said.

Cases of malicious damage to property, assault, and arson were opened. Investigations were continuing, Ngoepe said. Ledwaba again warned the community in the Zaaiplaas area that the suspects involved in the violence, characterised by the destruction of property, would be "hunted down and brought to book".
