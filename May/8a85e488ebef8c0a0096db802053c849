SPONSORED: An icon created in 1870 and untouched since, Hennessy X.O captures its seven flavor notes - Sweet Notes, Rising Heat, Spicy Edge, Flowing Flame, Chocolate Lull, Wood Crunches, and Infinite Echo - in an array of highly evocative imagery by London photographer Dan Tobin Smith for an unparalleled experience of the golden drop. Smooth yet so complex in texture, delicate but strong in aroma, bold but subtle in flavour, Hennessy X.O uses a unique concept of revolution to represent its different textures, notes, moods and elements through a topography of flowing liquid and gentle curves: Inspired by the Hennessy Comite de Degustation, this striking narrative weaves a 250-year rich tapestry and heritage, illustrated by the sophisticated elixir crafted by Hennessy’s master blenders. The result of Hennessy XO’s ‘seven facets’ are striking images that capture intangible sensations, perfectly depicting the spirit of the campaign’s storyline, “Each drop of Hennessy X.O is an odyssey.”
