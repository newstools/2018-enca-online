JOHANNESBURG - Platinum Stars striker Letsie Koapeng says relegated Dikwena will go all out in their last match of the season. Dikwena is at the bottom of the Absa Premiership table with 21 points but Koapeng says there’s no need for players to drop their heads when they host Bidvest Wits at the Royal Bafokeng Sports Palace on May 12.

We just need to focus on winning our next game and not really focus on what’s happening off the field. Getting a win in our last game will mean a lot to us. It will be good for the team and everyone’s confidence,” said Koapeng.  Koapeng, who joined Dikwena during the January transfer season, recently found his scoring form, netting two in the last two matches. He is cursing the fact that he found his scoring boots so late. “It’s always a good feeling as a striker to get your name on the scoresheet. I am just grateful to have got the two goals and to be scoring again. I wish I could have scored more for the team and helped more in the current situation. Football can be a cruel game and anything can happen, irrespective of how much quality you have in the squad,” said Koapeng.

Everyone will go out there to play for points but I think we need a win more than them. If we can work together as a team and unit and realize that this is the last 90 minutes that we have together, we can make it count,” said Koapeng. African News Agency
