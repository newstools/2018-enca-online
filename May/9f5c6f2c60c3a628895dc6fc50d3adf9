JOHANNESBURG - First National Bank said on Monday it had become the first bank in South Africa to introduce a mini-ATM that uses biometrics as a means of validation for consumers. The device device functions as a self-service kiosk from which customers can make withdrawals, transfers and payments, view statements, purchase airtime and electricity and perform card cancellations. It also people to open new accounts by reading a consumer’s thumb print. "The TouchPoint validates a customer’s identity by scanning a fingerprint placed on the biometric reader and it can detect false fingerprints to prevent fraud," said Lee-Anne van Zyl, CEO of FNB Points of Presence. "The identity of the customer is then verified with the department of home affairs to ensure the self-service account opening complies with the relevant laws."
