JOHANNESBURG - Renowned South African DJ Black Coffee appears to have put the Israel debacle behind him and has instead set his sights on the 25th edition of Sónar, Spain’s festival of advanced music and digital art. Last month, Black Coffee was on the receiving end of criticism from social media users after he shared a video of his "sold out" performance in Tel Aviv in Israel.

At the time, chairperson of the ruling African National Congress' international relations committee Lindiwe Zulu said: "We have been witnessing an unacceptable violation of children's rights, human rights and international law by the Israeli government. Further, we have been witnessing increased Israeli racism against Africans. "The cultural aspect of the boycott is critical in advancing the cause to ensure that we isolate what is clearly an apartheid government of Israel. It is therefore with deep concern that the ANC has learnt of the recent visit to Israel of Mr Nkosinathi Maphumulo, popularly known as Black Coffee."
