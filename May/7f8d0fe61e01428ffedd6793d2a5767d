JOHANNESBURG - The South African Transport and Allied Workers Union (Satawu) claims there is a new wage offer on the table. It says striking drivers are now being offered an increase of 8.75 percent for the first year and 8.25 percent for the second year. Employers were previously holding firm on their offer of an 8 percent increase in the first year and 8.5 percent in the second year. Satawu spokesman Zanele Sabela, says the offer was proposed by the South African Road Passenger Bargaining Council and the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA). They had suggested it be backdated to 1 April. The union will take the proposal to its members for consideration, she says.
