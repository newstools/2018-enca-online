The new councillor is Bonginkosi Mkhwauleni Zulu. The IFP gained the seat, previously won by ANC in #2016MunicipalElections, with 47.19% of the votes cast. Voter turnout was 53.06%. Support at Mtubatuba in northern KwaZulu-Natal is split between the ANC and IFP. The IFP received 44.86 percent of the vote during the 2016 local polls, with the ANC receiving 43.98 percent. An IFP-led council was formed after a coalition agreement with the Democratic Alliance and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). African News Agency
