JOHANNESBURG, May 29 (ANA) - The Independent Electoral Commission of SA (IEC) has finally released by-election results at KwaZulu-Natal's Mtubatuba Municipality, with the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) snatching the ward from the governing African National Congress (ANC). ''The party gained the seat previously won by the African National Congress during the 2016 municipal elections. The IFP received 47.19 percent of the votes cast compared to 37.19 percent won by the ANC in the municipal elections,'' the IEC said in a statement on Tuesday.

The ANC's attempt to interdict the by-election failed at the Durban High Court. Support at Mtubatuba in northern KwaZulu-Natal is split between the ANC and IFP. The IFP received 44.86 percent of the vote during the 2016 local polls, with the ANC receiving 43.98 percent. An IFP-led council was formed after a coalition agreement with the Democratic Alliance and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). African News Agency
