JOHANNESBURG - The Afro-Middle East Centre says South Africa is not at risk of terrorism. An explosive device found at the Imam Hussein mosque sparked fears the country could be targetted in terror attacks. Three men, including the mosque's moulana, were on Thursday injured when knife-wielding men attacked the mosque. One of the men died of his injuries. The attackers also set the KwaZulu-Natal mosque alight. Police are searching for the suspects. WATCH: Victim of deadly Durban mosque attack laid to rest The Afro-Middle East Centre’s Na'eem Jeenah said that South Africa had only experienced two incidents related to terrorism since 1994. “We have not been a target of a foreign terror organisation, and there isn't any reason to suspect that right now, foreign organisations have targetted South Africa. The last time a mosque was bombed in South Africa was in the 1990s and the culprits were the Boeremag." The South African Terrorism Analysis Centre says the attack on the Verulam mosque appears to be isolated. It also says the pipe bomb discovered at the mosque is the work of amateurs. According to Any Grundko of the SA Terrorism Analysis Centre: "I think there's a possibility that whoever carried out the attack - looking at the device - that doesn't look like it was planned. That would have been far more effective...(this was a) boy's idea of a pipe bomb." eNCA
