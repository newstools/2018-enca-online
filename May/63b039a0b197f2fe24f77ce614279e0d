JOHANNESBURG – Newly crowned Miss South Africa, Tamaryn Green,  has promised to show "unwavering commitment" to her duties over the next year.  Tamaryn Green was crowned Miss South Africa on Sunday night at Pretoria’s Times Square and will represent the country in the Miss Universe competition. "I promise to build on the legacy of all former Miss South Africa title holders and to represent my country with elegance, style, beauty and unwavering commitment,'' Green said.  Green is a Paarl-born medical student.  She will represent South Africa in Miss Universe after seeing off stiff competition from Johannesburg’s Thuluisa Keyi, who will be representing the country in Miss World.  This year, the competition awarded crowns to two competitors: one to compete in the Miss World competition and one in the Miss Universe competition.
