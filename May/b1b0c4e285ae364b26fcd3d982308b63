WATCH: ‘Tired’ AB de Villiers retires from international cricket Deputy minister Gert Oosthuizen said, ''We are pleased that he will be available for domestic games in South Africa and trust that he will continue to be available for the development of the game.'' De Villiers bows out of international cricket as one of the greatest players to have represented South Africa, having played 114 Tests, 228 One-Day Internationals and 78 T20 Internationals. He retired with an incredible Test average of 50.66 and as the fourth-highest run-scorer for South Africa with 8 765 runs (22 100’s).
