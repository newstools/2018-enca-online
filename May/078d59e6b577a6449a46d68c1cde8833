JOHANNESBURG – A pro-Jacob Zuma lobby group has confirmed that the formation of a political party is on the cards. Mazibuyele Emasisweni is one of the organisations holding a prayer service for the former president in his hometown, Nkandla, ahead of his court appearance next Friday.

Unfortunately, we are not yet a political party, we are only inviting views from the people on the ground in that regard,” said Reggie Ngcobo of Mazibuyele Emasisweni. Zuma, however, said he will not be starting a new political party. “I’m here to emphasise my commitment. People who think I will leave the ANC and form a new political party are people who do not know me. I sacrificed my family and everything else in my determination to fight for black people.” Ngcobo said the group is meeting with various stakeholders in forging a plan forward. “We have met with various stakeholders including the leaders in the taxi industry, the leaders of indabuko, Amakhosi, the unemployed groups, Yes, we have met with the veterans of the struggle and he is part of that ...hence they are still here even today.” Tweets by SiphamandlaGoge eNCA
