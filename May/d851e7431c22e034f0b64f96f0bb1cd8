PRETORIA – Tamaryn Green was crowned Miss South Africa 2018 at Times Square in Pretoria on Sunday night. The 23-year-old is a medical student from Paarl. This year the competition awarded crowns to two competitors: one to compete in the Miss World competition and one in the Miss Universe competition. Green is Miss Universe South Africa while Thulisa Keyi is Miss World South Africa. However, there can only be one reigning Miss South Africa and Green was the ultimate winner. An excited and overwhelmed Green said she was determined to make a difference during her reign.
	
	In her Miss South Africa acceptance speech, Green said: “I promise to build on the legacy of all former Miss South Africa title holders and to represent my country with elegance, style, beauty and unwavering commitment. Miss South Africa is so much more than just a competition. It is a calling, an opportunity to give back to the country that has richly provided so much to me so far.
	
	“As Miss South Africa I will be in a strong position to assist with the reconstruction of a better South Africa. I have always been passionate about making a positive and progressive difference in the lives of others. I grew up being exposed to two very different worlds: That of the fortunate and less fortunate. I want to assist in bringing those worlds together. I believe this can be done by providing equal education to all. Actions speak louder than words.  I want to be a voice to those who cannot be heard, a servant and role model to South Africans and to the people of the world at large.” Want to know more about the new Miss SA?
