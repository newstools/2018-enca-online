JOHANNESBURG – Rescue operations are continuing at Sibanye-Stillwater's mine in Driefontein near Carletonville on Gauteng’s West Rand where three workers remain trapped underground on Friday morning and two unaccounted for. At least four mineworkers have been killed, Sibanye-Stillwater spokesperson James Wellsted confirmed, saying the deaths were linked to a seismic event at the mine on Thursday. Wellsted said a quake measuring 2,2 on the Richter scale was recorded at its Masakhane mine. A total of 13 people were initially trapped. Six people are being treated in hospital while three others are yet to be located, Wellsted confirmed. Union anger The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), which previously accused the company of negligence, said it was angry at the latest incident.
