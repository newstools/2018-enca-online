JOHANNESBURG - MTN Group said on Wednesday that United States (US) President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear accord may limit the South African telecoms firm’s ability to repatriate cash from MTN Irancell, sending its shares lower. Trump said on Tuesday he would reimpose US economic sanctions on Iran, which were lifted under the agreement he had harshly criticised.
