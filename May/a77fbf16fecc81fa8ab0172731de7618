In a statement, Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille said she condemned the destruction of property that accompanied the demonstrations, saying both she and the local ward councillor had met with residents on a number of occasions. "... (City) officials showed the community leaders the three proposed pieces of land which could be developed for the benefit of the people of Vrygrond. This proposal was rejected by the community leaders," the statement said.
