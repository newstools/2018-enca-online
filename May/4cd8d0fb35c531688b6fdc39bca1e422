JOHANNESBURG – Commuters will continue to bear the brunt of the ongoing bus strike. Talks between unions representing bus drivers and employers once again broke down. The strike is now in its third week. Employers are holding firm on their offer of 8 percent increases in the first year and 8.5 percent increase in the second year. Employers say labour’s demand is simply unaffordable. READ: Nzimande confident of agreement on bus strike “Labour are still stuck on their demand of 9% backdated to April, and unfortunately that led to the breakdown,” said John Dammert of the employer caucus. The unions are now planning to intensify their strike. Satawu spokesperson Zanele Sabela, said: “This is what you call negotiating in bad faith, it is demoralising. How do you negotiate with people who keep changing their story?” Meanwhile, commuters and the poorest continue to suffer the consequences of the deadlock. eNCA
