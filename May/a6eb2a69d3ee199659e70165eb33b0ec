NEW YORK - Disgraced former Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein is expected to surrender to authorities in New York on Friday following a months-long investigation into allegations that he sexually assaulted women, US media reported. The New York Times said Weinstein was expected to surrender on Friday morning, citing unnamed law enforcement officials. Weinstein's defence attorney, contacted by AFP, declined to comment Thursday. The reports surfaced with the Manhattan District Attorney's office and New York police department have been investigating Weinstein for months. Weinstein was facing charges in connection to at least one accuser, Lucia Evans, who reported that the fallen power broker forced her to perform oral sex on him in 2004, the New York Daily News reported. The district attorney's office did not immediately respond to an AFP request to comment. Weinstein's career went down in flames last October over sexual abuse allegations following bombshell articles in The New York Times and New Yorker magazine, which sparked a sexual harassment watershed across the United States. More than 100 women have since accused the 66-year-old of impropriety going back 40 years and ranging from sexual harassment to assault and rape. The twice-married father of five has been investigated by British and US police but has not yet been charged with any crime. He denies having non-consensual sex and has reportedly been in treatment for sex addiction. AFP
