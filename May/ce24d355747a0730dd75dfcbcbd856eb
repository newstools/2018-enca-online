JOHANNESBURG - Former ANC Member of Parliament (MP) Makhosi Khoza has joined the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) as head of its local government programme, the organisation announced on Friday. ''Dr Khoza needs very little introduction as she has stood out as an ardent champion and fighter of corruption and maladministration within government.  At the risk of her own safety, Dr Khoza has become an icon for truth, justice and good governance within government. She is bold, courageous and comes with a history and experience that suits this role within OUTA,'' chief executive Wayne Duvenage told reporters in Johannesburg. READ: Makhosi Khoza retires from politics Khoza was among those who were vocal last year in calling publicly for former president Jacob Zuma's resignation. She subsequently resigned from Parliament, left the ANC and formed a political party, the African Democratic Change (ADeC). She was at the helm of the new party for just a few months before quitting in last month, citing a potential opportunity in ‘local government’. READ: Makhosi Khoza quits the ANC Khoza said she was ready to tackle the maladministration and corruption plaguing South Africa's municipalities. “It just makes more sense to make a difference in South Africa by empowering citizens on grass roots level and addressing maladministration and corruption in municipalities, free from politics. The intention here is to make a significant impact through civil society and not making noise in Parliament.'' African News Agency
