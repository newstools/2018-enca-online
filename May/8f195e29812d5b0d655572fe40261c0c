JOHANNESBURG – Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille on Thursday said her advocate indicated to the Democratic Alliance (DA) that they had rejected its offer. The DA, in answering court papers to an interdict brought by De Lille, indicated that the post of mayor and councillor would be kept open for three months. This pending a proper court hearing. De Lille said her lawyer rejected Wednesday’s offer as only the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) could decide whether to leave the posts vacant and not political parties. This means De Lille’s interdict application against the DA will go ahead in the Western Cape High Court at 10am on Friday. eNCA
