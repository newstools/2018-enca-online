JOHANNESBURG - Police Minister Bheki Cele is expected to speak at a memorial lecture on the killing of young women at the Soweto Theatre on Saturday afternoon. According to a statement by the police, the lecture is aimed at creating awareness against the killing of young women across the country. According to the @SAPoliceService statement: #KaraboMokoena’s family invited Cele to address the gathering promoting the message of “fighting the scourge of crimes against women and children.” The lecture follows a spike in murders of young women by their partners or ex-boyfriends in the last few months. "The scourge of women abuse is at its highest peak in the country, hence the Minister’s dedicated focus in ensuring that such crimes are brought to its knees," police said. One of the notable cases is that of Karabo Mokoena who was murdered by her ex-boyfriend Sandile Mantsoe last year.

The lecture is organised by the Moving Ahead Development Agency, a non-governmental organisation run by Karabo's uncle, Tshepo Mokoena. eNCA
