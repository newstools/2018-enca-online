DURBAN – Edward Zuma will issue a public apology to all South Africans and pay damages of R60,000 after his lawyers came to a settlement agreement in his hate speech case. The Human Rights Commission laid charges against former president Jacob Zuma's son in the Durban Equality Court. It followed comments Edward Zuma made about ministers Derek Hanekom and Pravin Gordhan in July 2017. Zuma had written a widely-circulated open later in which he called Hanekom and Gordhan "sell-outs". WATCH: Edward Zuma shouts at Gordhan Hanekom was described as "white monopoly capitalist offspring – who is no better than a vile dog trained to maul a black skin, showed us his true colours – and how the struggle of our people has been infiltrated by enemies – the racist-paternalistic minority." Zuma also called Hanekom a "white Afrikaner askari". Gordhan was labelled as "one of the most corrupt cadres of the ANC who thinks African natives are no better than just being sugar cane cutters who must be forever subservient to a master like him for sustenance." WATCH: Edward Zuma believes there's a witch-hunt against his father Zuma further accused the minister of wanting "natives to be perennially marginalised and always eat the leftovers dished by Indians and the white minority and its capital network. Gordhan as Gandhi sees black African natives as a low caste; K*** who are subhuman and deserve no status beyond that definition." He had opposed the HRC's application for R100,000 in damages and a public apology but on Tuesday morning assisted his lawyers in drafting the settlement agreement. The Equality Court declared Zuma's comments hate speech and his unconditional apology must happen within seven days, must be directed to all South Africans and will be published by the HRC. The R60,000 settlement will be donated to two needy schools in Durban. eNCA
