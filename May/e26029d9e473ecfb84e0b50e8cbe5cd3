CAPE TOWN - Former president Jacob Zuma has run out of money to pay his lawyers. Earlier this week, the Presidency agreed not to oppose any future court ruling on the State’s provision of legal fees for Zuma. READ: Presidency to abide by court ruling on Zuma's legal fees The Democratic Alliance (DA) asked the court to set aside a 2006 agreement between former president Thabo Mbeki and Zuma to pay for all legal costs incurred for his criminal prosecution. President Cyril Ramaphosa has revealed in several parliamentary replies the state has spent R15.3 million on Zuma’s legal fees, but experts say it is likely to be more with most senior advocates charging R50,000 a day. Now the DA want the former president to pay the money back. His long-time senior counsel, Kemp J Kemp, called Zuma’s legal fight to fight corruption charges "the Stalingrad approach," a reference to World War II when the Russians fought the German advance into Stalingrad, street by street, door by door. Jacob Zuma has cash concerns regarding legal fees. Longtime att Michael Hulley has confirmed to @Enca Adv Kemp J Kemp is not on brief for corruption trial, Hulley and Adv Gani are only acting for next court app. Review of Abraham’s decision to prosecute unlikely to happen. #Zuma But since 2006, Hulley has confirmed to eNCA that those days are over. Kemp is no longer on brief. Hulley himeslf and junior counsel Hoosen Gani are only confirmed until Zuma’s next court appearance on 8 June. Hulley said he had to terminate the counsel brief in light of the uncertainty from the Presidency and the lack of funds. This means, Zuma’s strategy to take Shaun Abraham’s decision to prosecute on review will no longer happen, the Stalingrad approach is no longer affordable, the piggy bank is empty and Zuma may have to go on trial sooner than anticipated. eNCA
