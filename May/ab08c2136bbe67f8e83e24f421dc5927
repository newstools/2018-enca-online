DURBAN – The DA in KwaZulu-Natal has lauded reports that the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (the Hawks) is investigating eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede for allegations of corruption, money laundering and fraud in the Durban metro. "This is a sign that (the) state institution can still be trusted by the public to ensure that crime is stamped out," DA KwaZulu-Natal leader Zwakele Mncwango said on Sunday.

"Today the DA is not only relieved by the fact that an investigation is underway, but that the integrity of state institutions like the Hawks is being reinstated. The Hawks must follow the money in order to clear out corruption. The arrest of corrupt politicians will minimise political killings in (the) province, as most killings are related to tender conflicts," Mncwango said.

"The DA will continue to fight for justice for all and keep the government of the day in check. South Africans need a government that does not make service delivery a rhetoric but implements it equally to all. The general public and civil society must take their rightful place in society and demand cleaner governments, the right way, as spelled out in our Constitution," Mncwango said. African News Agency
