JOHANNESBURG – Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba says he supports Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane's comments on white privilege. The City Press reported on Sunday that Maimane came under fire from three senior MPs at a DA parliamentary caucus meeting. However, the party is disputing that senior leaders are at loggerheads over Maimane's comments about racial inequality. Speaking at a Freedom Day rally in Soshanguve in Pretoria, Maimane said white privilege and black poverty must be addressed. On Sunday, he said on Twitter that he stands by the comments. His party colleague Mashaba said he endorsed those comments. “I am deeply proud to endorse your comments," he posted. The DA deputy federal chairperson, Natasha Mazzone - who is reported to be one of the people who were unhappy about Maimane’s remarks - says the party’s top brass did not attack him for his comments about white privilege. “There was absolutely no attack on our leader whatsoever,” Mazzone told eNCA. “In fact, I haven't had a more constructive and productive debate in a caucus in a very long time. “We're a political party and as such we must discuss things of a political nature. It was simply a discussion on what had happened in Soshanguve and media reports that came after it, and exactly how we as South Africans need to address this issues that so fundamentally affects all South Africans,” she said. eNCA
