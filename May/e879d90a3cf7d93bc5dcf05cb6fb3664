JOHANNESBURG – France’s plan to host a UN-sponsored conference on Libya aimed at securing elections in the North African country and commitments to a joint political roadmap from its warring factions, is already on shaky ground with the country’s most powerful brigades in the west rejecting the deal. The conference is due to kick off at the Elysee Palace on Tuesday, bringing together key Libyan players and representatives of two dozen countries and international organisations. Libya’s rival leaders were expected to adopt a statement calling for presidential and parliamentary elections, “if possible” by the end of the year.

In a letter to the Presidential Council, the High Council of State and the House of Representatives, 13 brigades and military councils called for a real dialogue inside the country that fulfils Libyans’ aspirations. Expressing commitment to the country’s sovereignty and unity, they rejected foreign interference in Libya’s internal affairs.
