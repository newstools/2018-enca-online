JOHANNESBURG – Kanye West's outrageous comments on slavery has sparked a tongue-in-cheek viral hashtag #IfSlaveryWasAChoice, in which social media users roast the rapper. Speaking to gossip publication TMZ Live, West revealed his thoughts about race and the history of slavery in the United States. "You hear about slavery for 400 years. For 400 years? That sounds like a choice," he said. West also came under fire recently after he proclaimed his love for US president Donald Trump, which lost him about nine million followers on Twitter. He did, however, regain those fans a few hours later. Kanye thinks slavery was "a choice" pic.twitter.com/zoPIDC8cSd #IfSlaveryWasAChoice
