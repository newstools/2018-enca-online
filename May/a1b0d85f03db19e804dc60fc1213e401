MAHIKENG - The South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) said on Saturday it was concerned that marginalising alliance structures and undermining communities would cost the ANC dearly in the 2019 national and provincial elections. North West province was hit with violent protests in the last few weeks calling for premier Supra Mahumapelo to resign. Sanco North West chairperson Paul Sebegoe called on the African National Congress NEC to intervene in the ongoing impasse over Mahumapelo's future. He said the unilateral revision of the ANC North West provincial legislature candidates nomination list without consultation with alliance partners was a divisive act that undermines unity. READ: Fraud-accused Wendy Nelson appointed acting North West Premier “The latest development and rumoured intended purge of members of the provincial legislature who have been vocal against allegations of corruption have not only deepened the current leadership crisis in the province, but have also confirmed the extent to which organisational structures are being used to institutionalise factionalism, weaken oversight, including accountability structures, and advance the (premier Supra) Mahumapelo fight-back strategy,” said Sebegoe. He said the ANC should not allow itself to be held to ransom by those who would stop at nothing to evade accountability. WATCH: I await PEC to ask me to resign, says Supra Mahumapelo "We call on the ANC NEC to intervene decisively in the current impasse in order to restore public confidence in governance and the ruling party. Organisational renewal and consolidation of elections structure must be prioritised while interventions at government level and investigations into alleged corruption which is robbing our communities of services unfold,” said Sebegoe.
