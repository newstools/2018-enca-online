JOHANNESBURG â€“ SA Express on Thursday had its operating licence suspended by the South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA). The airline also had its Aircraft Maintenance Organisation (AMO) approvals suspended as well as its Certificates of Airworthiness (CoA) on nine of its 21 planes. READ: SA Express needs government bailout The SACAA said the decision to revoke permits came after it conducted an audit of the airline and its maintenance organisation in the past several days. It uncovered severe cases of non-compliance that posed serious safety risks. The SACAA said the decision meant that SA Express could no longer continue operating as an airline. In order to operate again, SA Express will have to reapply and be issued with relevant approvals. Cash-strapped SA Express has also been at the centre of a corruption bombshell with Gupta-linked Trillian. WATCH: Changes announced for SOE boards Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan revealed the consulting company received R5.7-million and R67-million in a month for a dodgy fuel deal. Gordhan said it seemed the focus of some board members was not how to run an airline, but how to extract and steal. eNCA
