It is understood the speaker allegedly suspected undue influence and possible corruption in the process,” Mhlongo added. The Endumeni Local Municipality is an administrative area in the Umzinyathi District of KwaZulu-Natal. The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) in a statement on Thursday expressed shock at the news. “It is with shock and deep disappointment that the IFP has received the news that Mayor Mbatha of an IFP-led Endumeni Municipality was arrested on allegations of attempting to assassinate the Speaker of the same Municipality, who is also an IFP leader herself,” the party said. “As a matter of principle, we want to categorically state that as the IFP, we abhor any act of using violence to resolve whatever issues the people may have. “The IFP is fully aware and we are talking about allegations, for now. As such, we cannot pass any judgment on anyone implicated. However, what worries the IFP more is the fact that these allegations implicate a leader who is supposed to be exemplary,” it added. KwaZulu-Natal has been at the centre of political killings in recent months, as well as historically. *Additional reporting eNCA African News Agency
