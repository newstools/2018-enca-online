Hear the video above and let us know what you hear JOHANNESBURG - People are divided over the internet yet again and this time it's hitting our sense of hearing rather than seeing. You probably remember in 2015 the debate that took social media by storm -- on whether a dress (or rather THE dress) in a photograph, was blue and black or gold and white? Fast forward three years later, and we are back in the same predicament, only now it's based on whether people are hearing the word 'Yanny' or 'Laurel' in a soundclip that has gone viral this week. Considered the internet's "new dress" this web war began when a woman named Cloe Feldman posted a video on her Instagram story, simply asking "What do you hear?! Yanny or Laurel. Her four-second long clip has had 6-million views and 26,000 retweets. Even celebrities have taken up the challenge and have given their interpretations of the audio. The controversy caused Ellen DeGeneres to stop her show in order to ask people what they hear. DeGeneres hears Laurel. Chrissy Teigen agrees. Adding some humour to it, the model asked her parents what they heard. That pretty much threw the entire debate off course. Actress Mindy Kaling is adamant that it is Yanny. And to throw a spanner in the works, some hear both words. Shameless actress, Emmy Rossum manages to hear both Yanny and Laurel. And she doesn't seem to be the only one. As much as it's fun and games, the frustration has gotten too much and has caused audiologists, sound experts and well, normal folk on twitter to get involved and help solve this enigma. The New York Times reported that Dr Jody Kreiman, a principal investigator at the voice perception laboratory at the University of California, said this week that “the acoustic patterns for the utterance are midway between those for the two words.” She told the New York Times that: “The energy concentrations for Ya are similar to those for La.” “N is similar to r; I is close to l.” eNCA
