What do you hear?! Yanny or Laurel pic.twitter.com/jvHhCbMc8I Hear the video above and let us know what you hear JOHANNESBURG - People are divided over the internet yet again and this time it's hitting our sense of hearing rather than seeing. You probably remember in 2015 the debate that took social media by storm -- on whether a dress (or rather THE dress) in a photograph, was blue and black or gold and white? What color is this dress: White and Gold or Blue and Black?! http://t.co/gG27rAMVJy pic.twitter.com/Q9rNTSexln Fast forward three years later, and we are back in the same predicament, only now it's based on whether people are hearing the word 'Yanny' or 'Laurel' in a soundclip that has gone viral this week. Considered the internet's "new dress" this web war began when a woman named Cloe Feldman posted a video on her Instagram story, simply asking "What do you hear?! Yanny or Laurel. Her four-second long clip has had 6-million views and 26,000 retweets. Even celebrities have taken up the challenge and have given their interpretations of the audio. The controversy caused Ellen DeGeneres to stop her show in order to ask people what they hear. DeGeneres hears Laurel. Literally everything at my show just stopped to see if people hear Laurel or Yanny. I hear Laurel. https://t.co/efWRw1Gj0L Chrissy Teigen agrees. it's so clearly laurel. I can't even figure out how one would hear yanny. Adding some humour to it, the model asked her parents what they heard. I just asked my dad what he heard and he said "nothing" and my mom said "rural" That pretty much threw the entire debate off course. Actress Mindy Kaling is adamant that it is Yanny. It’s Yanny pic.twitter.com/p03ljzpomJ And to throw a spanner in the works, some hear both words. Shameless actress, Emmy Rossum manages to hear both Yanny and Laurel. I hear #yanny so clearly... but if I listen closely I can hear a deep quiet ghost saying #laurel.... so there... anyone else hear both? And she doesn't seem to be the only one. Me. https://t.co/aZj9NeOtOJ @MissRBaller Here we go again! #Yannyorlaurel pic.twitter.com/WpzJcGtXf4 As much as it's fun and games, the frustration has gotten too much and has caused audiologists, sound experts and well, normal folk on twitter to get involved and help solve this enigma. This EFFING Yanny vs. Laurel debate has been FREAKING ME out all morning. So I went and solved it with the very first episode of @NerdItUpPod Explains. It's effing Laurel. Also, Blue dress. I hate you all. #yannyorlaurel #yannyvslaurel https://t.co/R7XBm9DvaO Not to be a total nerd, but this is a frequency debate. Everyone will hear something different depending on the highs and lows they’re lacking. The real question is, “How’s your Hearing?” Btw...I hear laurel. Lol. #YannyorLaurel https://t.co/q8IWJfcYgi The New York Times reported that Dr Jody Kreiman, a principal investigator at the voice perception laboratory at the University of California, said this week that “the acoustic patterns for the utterance are midway between those for the two words.” She told the New York Times that: “The energy concentrations for Ya are similar to those for La.” “N is similar to r; I is close to l.” #YannyVsLaurel #yanny #laurel #yannyorlaurel #laureloryanny #laurelvsyanny
