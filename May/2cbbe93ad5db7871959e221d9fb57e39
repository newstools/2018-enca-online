CAPE TOWN - Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene has expanded the scope of a panel of experts appointed to review the current list of items exempt from value-added tax (VAT). "The amended terms of reference allow the panel more flexibility to make proposals that may alter the fiscal framework for the 2019/20 financial year and beyond, as they can be taken into account in the 2019 February Budget," the National Treasury said in a statement on Tuesday. The panel was appointed after the Treasury increased VAT from 14- to 15 percent in April to help raise an additional R36-billion as South Africa tries to narrow its budget deficit.
