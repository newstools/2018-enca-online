PARIS - French world rally championship team Citroen said Thursday they had sacked British racer Kris Meeke for reckless driving following a spate of crashes.

He and his Irish co-pilot Paul Nagle were dismissed with immediate effect. Due to an excessively high number of crashes, some of which were particularly heavy, CitroÃ«n Racing WRT has decided to terminate the participation of Kris Meeke and Paul Nagle in the 2018 WRC. #WRC

Team leader Pierre Budar said the decision had been taken as a preventative measure. "The decision has not been taken lightly because it affects a driver and a co-pilot but it is largely motivated by security considerations which are part of my concerns as team leader," he said. Meeke and Nagle, eighth in the current world rally championships, were involved in a spectacular crash in the recent Rally of Portugal but both emerged unscathed from the accident. AFP
