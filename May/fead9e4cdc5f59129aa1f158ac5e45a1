RUSTENBURG  -The North West tourism department will continue to contribute positively towards growing the economy of the province, Tourism member of the executive council (MEC) Desbo Mohono said on Friday. Tabling her departmental budget of R261,551 million for the 2018/19 fiscal year at the North West provincial legislature, she said that the contribution of the tourism sector was measured by the number of jobs it creates and its contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the amount of revenue created from activities within the sector. "The tourism sector is fundamentally a collaborative sector made up of a complex web of stakeholders. This is a depiction of the ACT [Agriculture, Culture, Tourism] cluster value chain e.g. Cata [Culture, Arts and Traditional Affairs]– paintings in and around our establishments by our local artists; food in our kitchens from our agricultural sector etc.  It is important that all of us, in government and the private sector pull in the same direction," she said. Mohono said that her department’s vision encourages and welcomes investment from all quarters while in the same breath offer policy certainty and always look for ways to unlock the barriers that inhibit growth and social inclusion. “Our commitment is to build strong partnerships in which the sector and all its role players work towards the common good," she said.
