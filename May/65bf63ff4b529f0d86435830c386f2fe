"With respect to the proposal of relocating parliament from Cape Town to Pretoria, an external service provider, Pamoja PTY LTD, has been appointed to conduct a six-month socio-economic and impact study commencing this month," Mbete said while opening the debate on Parliament's budget. "This is a matter that we will hand over to the sixth Parliament." READ: Zille wants Cape Town to be SA's capital Proposals to relocate Parliament from Cape Town were first mooted in the 1990s, but plans were shelved after strong opposition from the ANC in the Western Cape province. The proposal was again resuscitated by former president Jacob Zuma who said government could save billions if it did not have to fly and accommodate government officials and politicians from South Africa's administrative capital, Pretoria to Cape Town, the country's legislative capital. However, critics of the move, including the Cape Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said it could have a negative impact on businesses in the Mother City running into billions of rand.
