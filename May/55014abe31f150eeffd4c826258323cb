JOHANNESBURG - The Cosafa Cup will give South Africa a chance to enhance its profile on the African continent. The country will be hosting the 2018 Cosafa Cup (Council of Southern Africa Football Associations)after replacing Botswana who was named as the original hosts. The tournament will be played at three venues in the Limpopo Province from this Sunday and starts with the first round fixtures though Stuart Baxter's South African team will only join the tournament in the quarterfinal round when they face the winner of Group A on Sunday, June 3. South Africa is one of only two Cosafa member countries to have won the African Nations Cup title, doing so on home soil at their first attempt in 1996. Zambia joined them with their 2012 success. Bafana Bafana has also qualified for three World Cups, competing in France in 1998 and South Korea in 2002, and hosted the tournament in 2010.

But despite all that success, South Africa reached the final of Cosafa Castle Cup for the first time in 2002, winning the trophy with a 4-1 aggregate triumph over Malawi in the two-legged final.

They regained the title in Namibia in 2016, beating Botswana 3-2 in a thrilling final in Windhoek with a squad made up largely of players that would compete at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. The side then won the Plate final on home soil in 2017.
