JOHANNESBURG – Karabo Mokoena's family says the 32-year prison sentence handed down on Sandile Mantsoe is lenient. The South Gauteng High Court found Mantsoe guilty of killing his ex-girlfriend, Mokoena. WATCH: Sandile Mantsoe sentenced for killing Karabo Mokoena Karabo's father Thabang Mokoena, said: “The investigation and gathering the evidence judge decided he will do 5 years on assault and I didn't expect that I expected 15 years. On the 15 years, I expected life, on the burning which was so bad I expected more than 15 years but the law is law. Before I go on I'd just like to thank the community of Diepkloof people who were there to support us. The policemen, the Women's League, my friends who were there when there were bad times.” He said it will be hard to forgive his daughter's killer. “I wouldn't say I accept the apology, this is not the right time I mean this is the first day. Accepting the apology today will be very difficult I can't promise today or ever. This was bad because you know to bury a daughter... I understand, but a burnt body of the daughter I couldn't even see her it was bad. So apology... I don't think it was an appropriate word.” eNCA
