BARCELONA - Ground-breaking Spanish chef Ferran Adria plans to open a food laboratory in what used to be his legendary former restaurant El Bulli, which he closed in 2011. The lab, a centre for new gastronomic inventions dubbed el Bulli 1846, will open its doors between June and October 2019, Adria told AFP. "For seven years we have done many things to prepare this moment, and now it will be born," added Adria, considered one of the world's best chefs. Adria is one of the pioneers of a culinary art form known as "molecular gastronomy" that uses science to invent techniques that transform traditional dishes into fun culinary adventures.

"El Bulli has become a monster that had to be tamed and transformed," he told reporters at the time. But the renovation works were blocked due to environmental concerns since the former restaurant is located in the Cap de Creus nature park. Adria then scaled down the project and last week he received permission from municipal authorities to continue with the renovation of the building. AFP
