JOHANNESBURG - Actor and presenter Akhumzi Jezile was laid to rest in Johannesburg on Saturday, with the hymn It is Well with My Soul featuring at his funeral. Jezile was described as an influential, gentle soul who touched the lives of those around him, and the same can be said of the hymn. While a number of hymns were sung at the service for Jezile at Rhema Bible Church in Johannesburg, It is Well with My Soul was also quoted by those remembering him.

Spafford's young son died of pneumonia in 1871, the same year he lost most of his business in the great Chicago fire. In 1873, Spafford's wife and four remaining children, all girls, were crossing the Atlantic to Europe on a French ocean liner, the Ville du Havre, a journey he could not join them on as he had to address a business problem. The ship collided with another and among the 226 dead were all of Spafford's daughters. He booked passage on an available ship to join his wife, and when it sailed past the place where his children had died, the captain alerted him to it. According to Spafford's daughter Bertha Spafford Vester, who was born after the tragedy, her father wrote It is Well with My Soul while on this journey. The lyrics of the haunting hymn are as follows: When peace like a river attendeth my way, When sorrows like sea billows roll, Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say, It is well, it is well with my soul. Chorus: It is well with my soul, It is well, it is well with my soul (Source: St Augustine Record). You can watch eNCA's report on Jezile's funeral below.
