JOHANNESBURG - Viceroy Research Group is at it again and has released another report attacking Capitec bank. In the latest report, it says the bank’s audit committee is misleading investors. Earlier this year, a Viceroy report on Capitec claimed that it concealed losses triggered by a bloodbath in its share price. WATCH: Critics want probe into Viceroy Viceroy now claims recent results reflect deteriorating business conditions and misleading accounting practices. But one analyst says Viceroy is simply shining the spotlight on Capitec’s books. Herenya Capital Advisors’ Petri Redelinghuys said: “Viceroy is now coming back to the table and saying, if you look at the way the loan book is structured, the narrative is x. But if you look at management, the exact opposite is happening.” Despite the massive uproar the first report created in the market, investors do not seem concerned about this one. EXCLUSIVE: Viceroy founder defends report into Capitec “When the report initially came out, we saw some strong reactions come out with the share price and the sell-off lasted about 10 minutes, all in all. It popped straight back up,” Redelinghuys added. “Capitec is essentially trading in line with all the other banks in South Africa. The bank says it is studying the claims and will respond directly to Viceroy. Capitec said it remained committed to transparency. eNCA
