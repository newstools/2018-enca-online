The secretary-general of the South African Road Passenger Bargaining Council, Gary Wilson, says he's frustrated at the continuing nationwide bus strike. Talks between unions representing bus drivers and employers have collapsed yet again. Wilson says the council has tried hard to resolve the impasse. "I don't want to apportion blame to either side. My job is to be neutral, to be facilitating the process, and that's exactly what I've tried to do. "However, even with the assistance of the CCMA (The Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration) we were not able to do that. The CCMA wase accused of presenting wrong information, which was absolutely [not true]. It really tried very hard to get the parties together, to the point where it was so frustrated and ... said, 'Go back and consider your positions and once you have reached the point where you are willing to compromise, let us know.' "So, at this stage I'm waiting for the parties to come back to me and say: 'This is where we are, this is what we are willing to compromise on, and this is how quickly we can settle this dispute."
