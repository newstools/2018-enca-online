PARLIAMENT – Premier Soccer League officials appeared before a joint sitting of the Portfolio Committees on Sport and Police on Tuesday. The committees want to know what plans are in place to stop violence at stadiums. Kaizer Chiefs fans invaded the pitch at Moses Mabhida Stadium, attacking security guards after losing to Free State Stars last month in Durban. They caused damage estimated at R2.6-million. The police will also update the committee on their investigations. Meanwhile, two of the suspects are appearing at the Durban Magistrate's Court. eNCA
