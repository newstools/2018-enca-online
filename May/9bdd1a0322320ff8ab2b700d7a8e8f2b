CAPE TOWN - President Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday revealed he was planning a major overhaul of national government. He says the realignment will fix issues of inefficiency and ineffectiveness. He made the comments during the Presidency’s Budget Speech debate in Parliament. “The reconfiguration of the State is a far greater and a more ambitious undertaking that must go to the heart of the capacity of government to meet the country's developmental needs,” Ramaphosa told the National Assembly.

The data and the political will help us make the right choices,” Ramaphosa added.
