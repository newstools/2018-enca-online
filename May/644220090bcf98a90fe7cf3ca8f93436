CAPE TOWN - President Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday labelled Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) president Julius Malema as ‘desperate’. He says the two leaders are purposefully trying to misrepresent the African National Congress (ANC)’s policy of land expropriation without compensation. On Wednesday, Ramaphosa tabled the Presidency's budget vote in Parliament. The EFF's Members of Parliament (MPs), as well as the DA's chief whip, John Steenhuisen were all asked to leave the house in the subsequent debate. Ramaphosa on Thursday responded to the budget speech debate in Cape Town.
