POTCHEFSTROOM - Ongoing protests in North West over Premier Supra Mahumapelo have reportedly led to the Potchefstroom Hospital being shut down. On Friday, a ministerial task team was visiting the province to address several issues. Cabinet has invoked a section of the constitution allowing the national government to intervene when provinces fail to meet constitutional obligations. Last month, Cabinet placed the North West Health Department under administration. Health professionals in the province have been on strike for a month.

The South African National Defence Force subsequently deployed medical practitioners to the province. Anti Supra Mahumapelo Nehawu members have completely shut down Potchefstroom Hospital.
