JOHANNESBURG – As the National Child Protection week nears the end government has condemned gruesome acts of child abuse. Government Communication and Information System acting Director-General Phumla Williams expressed disappointment at reports of a nine-month-old child that was sexually abused. According to reports, the child’s aunt discovered injuries on the baby’s genitals after the mother had left her in the father’s care.

"The rights of the child has to be realised by the adult. Even though government has made the fight against child abuse a priority - we cannot overcome this scourge on our own. Families, neighbours and communities have vital roles to play. Let us as a nation not be rendered defeated in protecting the children of South Africa,” said Williams. eNCA
