Community leader Paul Lutchman says the Indian community at large, and especially in Chatsworth, has been neglected regarding visible policing. "Crime has gone out of control. As a community leader, I’m here to reconcile all the community members. But my plea to the government is: we need the army to be deployed. Our police are trying, but are under-resourced. My concern is why can’t we get help from the army so there can be a deterrent so that criminal elements don’t take advantage of the situation that is taking place all over the land right now”. On Monday night, about 2,000 Chatsworth residents took to the streets and gathered at the local police station to call for visible policing in Durban. An argument has broken out between police and some members of the community. Some protestors are accusing officers of being heavy-handed for no reason. #ChatsworthProtest pic.twitter.com/YwTENLK7Ny eNCA
