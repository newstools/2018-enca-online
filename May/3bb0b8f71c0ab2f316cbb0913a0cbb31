JOHANNESBURG – A Walter Sisulu University (WSU) academic, Dr Mmampho Gogela-Smith thrust the controversial issue of ulwaluko (Xhosa traditional male circumcision) into the public discourse with a thesis for her political and international studies doctoral degree at Rhodes University. In a statement issued by WSU on Thursday, Gogela-Smith, a manager at the institution's Centre for Learning, Teaching and Development investigated the intersection between culture, gender issues and politics for her thesis titled, Perceptions of ulwaluko in a liberal democratic state: is multiculturalism beneficial to AmaXhosa women in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa?

With regards to the HIV/AIDS module in the course, I observed that any attempt to discuss circumcision as a possible risk-reduction measure for HIV infection was met with a strong objection and open hostility from Xhosa men, and sometimes complete withdrawal,” said Gogela-Smith. She said male students argued that it was inappropriate and against traditional rules for women, boys and other cultural groups to speak about traditional circumcision.
