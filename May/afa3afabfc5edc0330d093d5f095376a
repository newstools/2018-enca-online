CAPE TOWN - The government is to review legislation that dictates the expiry date for prosecutions, specifically of sexual offenders, Justice Minister Michael Masutha said on Wednesday. "It has also become necessary to review the Criminal Procedure Act, 1977 which, among other things, prescribes the period within which the state can prosecute persons for allegations of particular categories of crime," Masutha said while delivering his budget vote speech in Parliament.

The review will also introduce harsher sentences for these offences." South Africa has a high prevalence of sexual offences against women and children, and there's been a recent wave of women killed by their partners. African News Agency
