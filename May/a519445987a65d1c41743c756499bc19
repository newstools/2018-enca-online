NORTH WEST - North West Premier, Supra Mahumapelo, says reporting the alleged death threats against him were not on his orders. He says threats come with the territory. "I did not even myself go to the police station to open the case. It's the security people working in government in the premier's office it's not me. So they are doing their work and I know people will try and change the narrative because Supra must be projected in a particular way," he says.

The most important thing to do is focus on my job as a leader of the ANC and a servant of the people," he says. "Other than that I said to my family because they are concerned I said to them I'm not the only one there are many other cadres of the movement. If you look at other leaders in business, public service, sport, who face these challenges. So leave everything in the hands of the almighty," says Mahumapelo. The allegations come amidst growing calls for the embattled premier to step down, with violent protests rocking the city's capital Mahikeng in recent weeks. A case of conspiracy to commit murder has been opened at the Mahikeng Police Stati eNCA
