PARLIAMENT – The Minister of Sport and Recreation Thokozile Xasa told MPs on Tuesday she has requested President Cyril Ramaphosa institute a judicial commission of inquiry into violence at soccer matches in South Africa. Briefing a joint meeting of the Portfolio Committees of Police and Sport on the recent violence that erupted at the Moses Mabhida Stadium, which saw at least 18 people injured, Xasa said incidents such as this had the potential to tarnish South Africa's reputation.

"At our submission, we sought also to include Moses Mabhida in the judicial commission but in the interim... we had to meet both Safa (South African Football Association) and the PSL (Premier Soccer Leagues) so we get to understand (what happened). They have submitted an interim report." African News Agency
