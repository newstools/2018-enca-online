PORT ELIZABETH – Protesting students shut down some of the Nelson Mandela University campuses in Port Elizabeth on Wednesday. The South African Students Congress (Sasco), which is leading the protests, said it is concerned about the slow pace at which the new free higher education policy is being implemented. Sasco said students cannot be expected to continue with tests, exams and assignments without textbooks.

Students are also complaining about safety on campuses. “It can’t be that when Sasco is in charge, students are not going to be happy. And when Sasco is in charge students must be happy, because it remains the only student organisation that understands the issues that affect students personally. On Friday, we want to have a date with the mayor of the metro, (Athol) Trollip. We want to march to him. We are marching to him to say students are crying in your municipality. What is it that you are willing to do? What is it that you are willing to contribute to students?” said the president of Sasco at Nelson Mandela University, Bamanye Matiwane. eNCA
