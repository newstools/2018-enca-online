DURBAN – Two more suspects have handed themselves over to police following the pitch invasion and violence at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban last month. Mayhem broke out shortly after Free State Stars beat Kaizer Chiefs, leaving 21 people injured. Stadium equipment worth R2.6-million was also damaged. KwaZulu-Natal police said both suspects appeared in the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday on charges of public violence. Nolwethu Cokotha (29) and Zibongile Njona (27) made a brief appearance in court, where they were granted bail of R1,000 each, pending their next court appearance.

Warrants of arrest will be obtained to arrest those that do not hand themselves over shortly. “We are appealing to those injured in the stadium violence to also contact our investigating team. At this stage, we have their names. However, we do not have their contact details.
