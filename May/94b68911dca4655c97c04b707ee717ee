BUSHBUCKRIDGE – Legendary photographer Sam Nzima died while preparations were under way for him and his family to move into a new double-storey house built for him by Deputy President David Mabuza, Nzima's eldest son Thulani Nzima said on Saturday. Thulani told the African News Agency (ANA) that his father collapsed on May 10 at their old home in the same village, about 5km away from the new house. “He was sorting out the key to the house when he collapsed. “My father was happy for the house. He particularly liked the balcony for the fresh air. He also posed for a number of pictures in many parts of this house,” Thulani said.

Sam Nzima died on May 12 at Rob Ferreira Hospital in Mbombela (Nelspruit) after a short illness. He was 83. Nzima is best known for capturing the famous picture of Mbuyisa Makhubu carrying Hector Pieterson after the latter was shot during the 1976 Soweto uprisings. Thulani said his mother Thelma Nzima continued with the preparations to move into the house after her husband was admitted to hospital. He said his father had been earning most of his income by renting out a property consisting of a liquor shop and a butchery, which is situated in the yard of their old home in the village.
