JOHANNESBURG - The ANC Youth League is calling on disgraced NEC member Mduduzi Manana to resign. It's condemned Manana's behaviour, saying it’s barbaric and unjustifiable. The league has described Manana's behaviour as a reflection of a society's violent attitude towards women and children. READ: Parliament considering Manana complaint The comments come after the senior party member was accused of assaulting his domestic worker at his Johannesburg home. Christine Wiro opened an assault case against him but has since withdrawn it. An audio recording of Manana offering to pay Wiro off has also surfaced. Last year, he was convicted on three counts of assault. eNCA
