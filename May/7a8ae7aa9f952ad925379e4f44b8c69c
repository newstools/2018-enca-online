JOHANNESBURG - The fight for land expropriation continues as residents of Zandspruit in Johannesburg invaded a piece of land on Friday. They say they’ve waited for far too long and are now taking matters into their own hands. The ward councillor has condemned their actions and says projects are in place to give them houses. Residents targeted a piece of land near the Honeydew informal settlement, with some building homes and others even spending a night there. Despite police attempts to remove them several times, they say they’ll keep coming back to rebuild. “The police are doing their jobs, we will also continue with ours,” said community leader Silindlelwa Peter. In January, Zandspruit residents staged violent protests to demand proper housing. A petrol station was looted and police fired rubber bullets to disperse protesters. Zandspruit residents also staged violent service delivery protests in 2016. In 2014, they were evicted from a piece of land they had occupied illegally. Service delivery protests in Zandspruit date back as far as 2011.
