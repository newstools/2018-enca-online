PRETORIA - Pretoria police are investigating the deaths of three men whose decomposed bodies were found inside a cave. The cave is located on private property frequented by Zion Christian Church (ZCC) members. No arrests have been made and police are yet to identify the remains of the victims. Owners of the property say they fear for their lives after the gruesome discovery. The cave is located on 50 hectares of privately-owned land. Tina Vanezis has lived on the property all her life and says many people visit the farm for religious reasons.

They didn’t care what we said, they said they were still going to go there because the cave is their God, Jehova's cave and we can do whatever we want," Vanezis said, adding “They were very intimidating and very aggressive.” “Since this guy has been living here for four months, we now have three dead bodies,” she added. The last time Vanezis went into the cave, she was met with a stench and the grim sight of two decomposing bodies. Specialised police units were then called in. A further search led police to the banks of the Hennops River, where a third body was unearthed. Authorities say the bodies could have been in the cave for several weeks. A man was questioned by police but later released.

Since this guy has been here, we’ve been too scared to come home and too scared to leave our house because he sits up on the mountain watching our every move.” Police said they would be searching the property for more bodies. eNCA
