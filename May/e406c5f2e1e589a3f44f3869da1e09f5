PORT ELIZABETH - Jailed African National Congress (ANC) councillor Andile Lungisa is expected to bring an urgent application for bail in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate’s Court on Thursday. Lungisa’s new lawyer, Alwyn Griebenow, has lodged a petition in the Port Elizabeth High Court after leave to appeal Lungisa’s conviction and sentence was dismissed by Magistrate Morne Cannon. Last month, Lungisa was found guilty of intentionally smashing a glass jug over the head of former mayoral committee member for transport, Rano Kayser, during a chaotic 2016 Nelson Mandela Bay council meeting. He was sentenced to an effective two years behind bars.

Kayser falls backwards onto the floor. Cannon said the video showed that there had been no reason for Lungisa to hit Kayser, thereby dismissing Lungisa’s self-defence claim. The court found that Lungisa lacked genuine remorse and was a poor witness, adapting his version as he went along. Kayser sustained multiple lacerations to his head and neck, with pictures showing him drenched in blood. Since then, he said he suffered from short-term memory loss and was told that he was lucky to be alive. Lungisa’s co-accused, ANC councillor Gamalihleli Maqula, was acquitted on charges of assault with the intent to cause grievous bodily harm. Maqula was accused of stabbing council chief whip Werner Senekal with a sharp object during the chaotic council meeting.
