"I think we could elect anybody, and I think you can conclude that South Africans will feel much more optimistic just by virtue of where we were, but what we need to realise is that the view that Mr Ramaphosa is suddenly angelic and is flown from somewhere is amiss because he was the deputy president in Zuma's administration for a number of years," said Maimane. Ramaphosa must account for things that took place during Zuma's reign, said Maimane.
