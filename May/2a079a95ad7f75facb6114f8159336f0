CAPE TOWN – The City of Cape Town's acting mayor Ian Neilson plans to appoint a new mayoral committee for the city on Monday afternoon. "I am required by statute to appoint a mayoral committee (Mayco) to assist me in the governance of the city, and I am ready to do so," he said on Sunday. On Friday, former mayor Patricia de Lille launched an urgent application in the Western Cape High Court for an interim order reinstating her membership of the DA and as mayor pending the determination of an application by her for final relief against the party, which will be heard on May 25.

"I am advised that, legally, nothing precludes me from proceeding with the appointment of a Mayco, but out of respect to the court I will delay making the appointment until 3pm on Monday, 14 May 2018. WATCH: De Lille says DA offered her MP job to quit as mayor "If by then, the High Court has not ruled on alderman De Lille's application, upholding her application for the interim order, I will proceed with the appointment of a new Mayco. I will not be able to wait any longer than that because without a Mayco from early in the coming week the governance of the city will be compromised. "Among other things, a Mayco is required to give political guidance to the budget process, which is far advanced, for the forthcoming municipal financial year. I will convene a Mayco meeting for Tuesday morning," Neilson said. African News Agency
