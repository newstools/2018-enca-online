JOHANNESBURG - Financial services group Liberty Holdings says retail insurers experienced a three percent decrease in new business to R1.503-billion in the quarter ended 31 March, compared with the same period in 2017. Liberty, which operates in 24 countries in Africa, said on Friday that recurring-premium-investment and risk business sales were flat, with a decrease in single-premium business partly attributable to a continued migration to off-balance-sheet products.
