JOHANNESBURG - The leader of the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu), Joseph Mathunjwa, says God is on the side of mine workers. Speaking at a memorial service for the seven miners who died at the Sibanye-Stillwaters mine in Driefontein last week, Mathunjwa quoted the New Testament. "God says you do not pay these workers. They boost the economy but you don’t pay them. Mines are emptying but the people are not benefiting. You go to their homes and it’s nothing but poverty, even though the person has been working at the mine for 30 years. "As Amcu we’re here to support you NUM [National Union of Mineworkers] so we can push for workers to have better lives. Support us as we move to wage negotiations now." *For Mathunjwa's full comments, watch the video above. eNCA
