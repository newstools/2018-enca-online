JOHANNESBURG - The South African Football Association (Safa) on Tuesday postponed this weekend’s elective congress. In a statement by the body’s National Executive Committee (NEC) following a meeting on Tuesday, a unanimous decision was made “in order to address any issues that may impact the credibility of the congress.” READ: Jordaan now sole contender for Safa presidency The NEC agreed to the postponement in order to "give the new Electoral Committee (EC) enough time to thrash out all compliance matters." It called on all regions that were yet to fully complete their electoral process to do so urgently. Safa's NEC also had a warning for those who approached the courts. “Individuals who take football cases to a court of law must be reported to Fifa, in-line with the world football governing body and where appropriate, Safa should recommend that such individuals receive worldwide bans, as per Fifa rules,” the statement said. According to Safa, Chief Mwelo Nonkonyana who lost his case in the courts on 20 March 2018, should be banned for life and Safa should start processes to recoup all money as a result of these legal battles. Danny Jordaan is currently the sole candidate for the position of Safa president. The other nominee, former PSL referee Ace Ncobo, withdrew from the presidential race earlier in March. Ncobo as well as Nonkonyana had attempted to stop elections from taking place, citing governance concerns. But according to Fifa representative Phillip Chiyangwa, all matters were resolved. According to Safa, the new date for polls would be announced "shortly". eNCA
