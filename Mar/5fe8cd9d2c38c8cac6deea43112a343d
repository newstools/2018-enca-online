CAPE TOWN – Former public enterprises minister Lynne Brown has resigned as a member of Parliament. Brown was one of the casualties in President Cyril Ramaphosa’s new cabinet announced on Monday. Her tenure as minister of Public Enterprises was overshadowed by allegations of state capture at state-owned companies. She has been replaced by former finance minister Pravin Gordhan in the national executive. WATCH: Mokonyane reports back after cabinet meeting ANC Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu says that Brown’s resignation is effective from 27 February 2018. “She (Brown) has expressed her gratitude in having served the people of South Africa and thanked the ANC for having given her the opportunity to do so,” said Mthembu. “We are confident that she will continue serving the country and our movement in other capacities in future. We wish her well.” Brown joined the National Assembly in 2014 and had previously served as a member of the Western Cape Provincial Legislature in various capacities from 1994 till 2014, including as premier from 2008-2009. eNCA
