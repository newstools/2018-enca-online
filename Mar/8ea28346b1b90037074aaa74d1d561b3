JOHANNESBURG - The African National Congress (ANC) on Friday said it was officially in election mode. South Africans head to the polls in 2019 for the sixth general election since democracy. READ: Mbalula appointed to head ANC’s elections machinery The governing party is holding a National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting in Cape Town to discuss, among other things, the National Prosecuting Authority reinstating charges against former president Jacob Zuma. Just two weeks ago, Zuma was on the campaign trail for the ANC and now party leaders must decide whether he will be asked to lobby or not. ANC secretary general Ace Magashule said all former leaders had a role to play. “Just give us the space to do that," he said. “We have said the two presidents and comrade [Kgalema] Motlanthe must find space within the ANC to do work. We will determine what work they must do.” ANC SG @DrAceMagashule briefing members of the media at the NEC meeting currently underway in Cape Town pic.twitter.com/I0cOqxLaub ANC SG @DrAceMagashule , We are currently discussing the political overview by the President #ANCNEC ANC SG @DrAceMagashule we will also be giving the report of the NWC in terms of readiness for elections #ANCNEC ANC SG @DrAceMagashule We are also discussing the resolutions of the conference as we move on , we reflect all the time #ANCNEC ANC SG @DrAceMagashule we are also looking at international space in terms of international relations in particular with the continent eNCA
