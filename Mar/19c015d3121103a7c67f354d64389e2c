BETHLEHEM – Police in the Free State on Thursday issued a warning to people intending to hitch-hike to their destinations ahead of the Easter holidays to beware of criminals after two women were raped in Tweeling in the province. “You could end up raped, trafficked or robbed,” said acting Bethlehem cluster commander Brigadier Nkaise Molefe. Police said a 29-year-old woman had laid a charge of rape after she and another woman were picked up by two men in Vosloorus on Friday evening. "The two women, who are unknown to each other, were both desperately looking for transport to Warden. These good-hearted men who had taken pity on the vulnerable soon turned into monsters," a police statement said.
