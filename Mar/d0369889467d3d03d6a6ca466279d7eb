MONTREAL - Quebec will start applying a sales tax to some internet companies such as Netflix and AirBnb from 2019, according to the government of the French-speaking Canadian province. But only internet platforms selling "intangible goods or services" will be obliged to pay the provincial sales tax set at 9.975 percent, according to the 2018-2019 budget presented by the Liberal government of Premier Philippe Couillard. Foreign platforms will have to register in Quebec in order to sell their services to the people there.

Companies that are Canadian but based outside Quebec will have to do so starting on 1 September next year. Online retailers such as Amazon will be spared. Canada is waging a campaign against tax dodging by big online companies. The federal government said recently it wanted to go after internet giants, although it did not say when. AFP
