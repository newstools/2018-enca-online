JOHANNESBURG - EFF leader Julius Malema says the deputy chief justice should not have appointed former auditor-general Terrence Nombembe as the investigative head of the state capture inquiry. He says the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants and Nombembe, its CEO, are captured. "... yet he is going to investigate state capture! The deputy chief justice should have known this if he followed issues in South Africa and who are possible suspects," said Malema. WATCH: EFF hosts press briefing "We in the EFF intend to call Nombembe to answer in a commission. How is he going to answer if he is the investigator himself? Deputy Chief Justice [Raymond Zondo] is starting on wrong a footing, I am warning you South Africa," he said. "We may find that the intention was good but something else may be the different product here." Malema said the EFF will monitor the commission and keep a close eye on each and every individual including the ones "in the printing room and photocopying room". He says the EFF is suspicious that there is something wrong with the commission. Zondo announced his inquiry team on Wednesday and thatÂ Nombembe would head the investigation of state capture. eNCA
