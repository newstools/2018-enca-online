Morkel’s return of 4/87 in 20 overs that included his 300th Test match wicket was well supported by Kagiso Rabada (3/81 in 19) and the ever-economical Vernon Philander (2/26 in 15) as Australia reached the close with one wicket remaining.

Rabada first helped Dean Elgar put on 50 for the Proteas ninth wicket that enabled them to stretch the overnight 266/8 to a far more respectable 311 all out. South Africa worked steadily through the Australian order, taking two wickets in the short first session, three in the second and a further four in the final one as Cameron Bancroft (77 off 103 balls, 13 fours) scored the visitors’ only half-century. The Proteas looked set for a lead well into three figures until Australia produced their own ninth-wicket partnership of 66 that included a career-best 47 off 38 balls (8 fours) by Nathan Lyon in support of Tim Paine.

Elgar had earlier carried his bat for 141 (284 balls, 20 fours and a six) to join the West Indies Great, Desmond Haynes, as the only player to do this on three occasions. Remarkably, Elgar has achieved two of those in his last four Test matches. On the Australian side there was a world best for Steve Smith who provided the 11th instance of a fielder taking five catches in a Test match innings. African News Agency
