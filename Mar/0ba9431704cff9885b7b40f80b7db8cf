CAPE TOWN - Steve Smith and David Warner will stand down as captain and vice-captain for rest of Australia's third Test match against South Africa, Cricket Australia said on Sunday as it investigates a ball-tampering scandal. Tim Paine will step in as acting captain for the remainder of the Test in Newlands, CA chief James Sutherland said in a statement. "Following discussions with Steve Smith and David Warner they have agreed to stand down as Captain and Vice-Captain respectively for the remainder of this Test match," Sutherland said. Smith said he was embarrassed and took responsibility for the actions of his side after they were charged with attempting to change the condition of the ball on Saturday but he will not be stepping down as skipper. Opening batsman Cameron Bancroft, the most junior member in the side, was the player charged by the International Cricket Council (ICC) for trying to change the condition of the ball using sticky tape and grit from the pitch. - Additional reporting Reuters AFP
