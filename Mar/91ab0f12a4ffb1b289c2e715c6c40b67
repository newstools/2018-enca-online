JOHANNESBURG – Cape Cobras opener Pieter Malan was closing in on 900 runs for the season after his unbeaten 175 left the Sunfoil Series clash between the Cape side and the Titans headed for a draw after the third day of action in Paarl on Saturday. The opener struck 14 fours and one six in his 443-ball knock – completing his fourth ton of the season and 27th overall – that left his side on 393/3 by stumps at Boland Park.
