CAPE TOWN â€“ The search for a third body at Monwabisi beach in Cape Town has been called off. Three men drowned during a baptism there this morning. Police divers have so far only recovered two bodies. According to the City of Cape Town's Wayne Dyason, the search was called off by the SAPS and the city's fire department due to weather considerations. According to Dyason, two members of the church group got into difficulty while in the water. Another member of the group tried rescuing them, but also suffered the same fate. Dyason said the beach is a regular venue for baptisms. He has advised churches to alert officials whenever there are baptisms in order to have lifeguards. eNCA
