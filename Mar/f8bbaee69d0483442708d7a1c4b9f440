Local and international visitors say they go up the pyramid to feel the energy and connect with a forgotten past while many foreign visitors express awe. The name Teotihuacan, "The Place Where Men Become Gods," was given by Aztecs who inhabited the area 700 years after the city was abandoned around 600 CE. The Aztecs were fascinated by the monumental buildings and precise city planning. Experts believe that The Pyramid of the Sun was probably a fertility symbol built around 80 CE and shaped like a mountain to counteract the evil influence of two nearby volcanoes known to have gone through unusually violent eruptions at the time.
