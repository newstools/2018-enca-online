NEW YORK - Music's first couple Beyonce and Jay-Z on Monday announced a new joint tour in what will probably mark some of the year's most lucrative concerts. The singer and the rapper, who in June celebrated the birth of twins, will open the stadium tour on 6 June in the Welsh city of Cardiff. The 36-date show will travel across Europe, including a Bastille Day show at the Stade de France in Paris, before a North American leg that closes on 2 October in Vancouver. Beyonce announced the tour in a series of posts to her 112 million Instagram followers. Beyoncé just confirmed the OTR II TOUR pic.twitter.com/gaB19SkxLU She also posted a half-minute video.

Beyonce is set to return to the stage in April to headline Coachella, the biggest-name US music festival, in her first performance since giving birth to the couple's second and third children. For Jay-Z, the tour follows solo concerts to promote "4:44," his introspective last album in which he notably apolosizes to Beyonce for infidelity. AFP
