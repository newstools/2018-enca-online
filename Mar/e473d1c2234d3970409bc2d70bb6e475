JOHANNESBURG - Tiger Brands is to remove all Enterprise products from shelves following the linking of polony to listeriosis. Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi announced earlier that an Enterprise factory in Limpopo had been found to be the source of the outbreak of the disease. More than 170 people have died. BREAKING: Polony the origin of listeriosis outbreak Shoprite said it had on Sunday afternoon started removing all ready-to eat-processed meat products produced by Enterprise Foods and Rainbow Chicken from its perishable departments and delicatessens. The National Consumer Commission had issued these manufacturers with notices to recall all products produced in their Polokwane, Germiston and Free State factories and to cease production as a result of tests linking the plants to theÂ Listeria monocytogenes ST6 strain, Shoprite said. "Customers are also invited to return any Enterprise Foods and Rainbow Chicken processed meat (cold meats like polonies, Viennas, Russians etc) products they have at home for a full refund," Shoprite said.
