JOHANNESBURG – One million Swazi emalangeni (nearly R989,000) that had been allocated and intended for retired and disabled people in Swaziland, has reportedly been given to King Mswati III to help pay for his 50th birthday party. “The money has been donated by the Swaziland National Provident Fund (SNPF) for the so-called 50/50 Celebrations on April 19 to mark the King’s birthday and the 50th anniversary of Swaziland’s Independence from Great Britain,” Richard Rooney wrote on the blog, Swazi Media. “Already all police officers and soldiers in the kingdom have had money deducted from their salaries to contribute to the celebrations."

The SNPF was established in 1974 as a retirement savings scheme to provide benefits to retirees or those who became disabled and unable to work.
