Trent Alexander-Arnold, Virgil van Dijk, Andrew Robertson and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain also drop out to make way for Joe Gomez, Joel Matip, Alberto Moreno, James Milner and Adam Lallana. Porto boss Sergio Conceicao showed his priorities very much lie in winning the Portuguese title back off Benfica as he makes 10 changes from their first-leg hammering. Only Diego Reyes remains from Porto's heaviest-ever home European defeat as goalkeeper Iker Casillas returns for a record 167th appearance in the Champions League.
