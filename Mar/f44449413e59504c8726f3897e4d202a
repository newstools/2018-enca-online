TRIPOLI - A strike by workers at the Libyan oil port of Zawiya delayed loading activity on Monday but negotiations were under way to resolve the dispute, several oil and trading sources said. Workers at Zawiya, which exports crude from Libya's giant El Sharara field, were protesting over salaries, one Libyan oil source said. Several other sources said that negotiations over the dispute were ongoing. The Seagrace tanker, which was docked at Zawiya on Monday, was due to load on Tuesday, according to Reuters ship tracking data. Reuters
