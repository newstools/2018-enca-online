JOHANNESBURG - The CRL Rights Commission says it's going to approach the Constitutional Court for clarity on its powers. The commission says Parliament ignored its warnings about the dangers posed by the Mancoba Seven Angels Ministries last year. The Commission’s chairperson Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva said she told Parliament that something horrible was going to happen at the church. She said lives could have been saved if Parliament acted sooner. #eNgcoboChurch: CRL Rights Commission Chairperson, Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva, speaks to @ZikhonaTshona after unpacking the latest developments regarding the Seven Angels Ministries Church.
