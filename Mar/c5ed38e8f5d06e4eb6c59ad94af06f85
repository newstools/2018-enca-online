JOHANNESBURG – The South African government has made formal submissions to ask for the country to be excluded from United States (US) President Donald Trump's proposed steel and aluminium tariffs. The Minister of Trade and Industry said South Africa posed no threat to the US steel and aluminium sectors. Exports of aluminium products, per annum, are only equivalent to about 1,6 percent of the total US aluminium imports and less than one percent of steel. The department says South Africa's inclusion in the tariff increase would have a negative impact on productive capacity.
