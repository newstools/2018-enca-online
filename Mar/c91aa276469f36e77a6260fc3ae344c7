		commitment. We are proud to be part of this award-winning City. Looking forward to achieving more accolades together.

This is a testament to the hard work of the staff and management at the airport, who work hard every day to ensure travellers are treated with respect and care.” Cape Town International also ranked number 21 of the best 100 airports, globally. Winde said he hoped this would help grow the tourism and hospitality industry in the province. African News Agency
