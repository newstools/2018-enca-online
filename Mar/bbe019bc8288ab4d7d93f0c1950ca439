JOHANNESBURG - The South African Revenue Service (SARS) has asked debt collectors to recover about R16.6-billion owed to it. The move is aimed at boosting revenue collection for the taxman by outsourcing the recovery of older and relatively small amounts due. WATCH: SARS rogue unit saga back with senior staffers charged At least 2.3 million taxpayers and traders currently owe just under R150-billion to the revenue service. SARS has, however, warned taxpayers not to pay money directly to the debt collection agencies. The contract awarded to eight collection agencies is effective immediately and is set to run until the end of February 2019. eNCA
