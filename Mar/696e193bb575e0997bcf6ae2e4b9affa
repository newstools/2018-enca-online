JOHANNESBURG – The criminal justice system in the Sahel region is being strengthened by a special programme by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). In 2017, law enforcement officers based in the airports of Bamako (Mali), Niamey (Niger) and Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) seized more than 35 kilograms of drugs and more than $1-million in foreign currencies. UNODC is helping governments in the Sahel region to jointly fight corruption, and human and drug trafficking.

We are seeing an increase in national and regional ownership, which positively impacts the security situation in the Sahel,” he says. Just weeks ago, in early February, Joint Airport Interdiction Task Force agents in Ouagadougou seized 4.8 kg of heroin off a single passenger. On the judicial side, too, government efforts are yielding results. Last year, Niger secured its first two convictions for terrorist financing, involving eight suspects, and a third conviction for participation in terrorist acts, involving one suspect, UNODC says. Furthermore, supported by UNODC and UN volunteers, Niger judicial authorities processed some 230 cases of terrorism. Governments are also making strides in the battle against corruption. Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger have already ratified the UN Convention against Corruption, and Chad is currently taking steps towards ratification. Anti-corruption laws are being developed in countries and increasing numbers of cases are being investigated and transferred to justice systems. eNCA
