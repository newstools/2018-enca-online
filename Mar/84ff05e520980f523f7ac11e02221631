JOHANNESBURG - Local government bonds were marginally firmer on Tuesday morning‚ tracking overnight gains in the rand‚ as investors waited for a series of risk events later in the week. Local exporter interest in the rand helped the unit strengthen‚ while foreigners continued to be net buyers of local bonds‚ as they had for the past two weeks‚ said Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking analysts. The rand was flat on Tuesday morning‚ but has recovered about 20c from its worst intraday levels on Monday.
