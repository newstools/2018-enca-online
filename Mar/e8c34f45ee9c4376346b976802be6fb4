JOHANNESBURG - The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) says while almost all voting stations around the country were reported open and operational from 8am on Saturday morning, incidents across the country led to some voting stations not opening. In a statement, the IEC says the most common reason for voting stations not opening is due to community protests "which used the high profile of the voter registration activities to draw attention to their grievances and in some instances blockaded staff and voters from reaching the voting stations or conducting registrations."

It goes on to say that two accidents involving election personnel on their way to open voting stations occurred on Saturday morning. "In both incidents, the staff members were hospitalised, one with minor injuries and one with more serious injuries. The Commission wishes them a speedy recovery." eNCA
