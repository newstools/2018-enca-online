JOHANNESBURG – The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) has warned the number of malaria cases is expected to rise in Limpopo, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal due to an influx of travellers during the Easter holidays. In a statement released on Tuesday, the NICD said another cause of the increase was the recent widespread rainfall across southern Africa.

Other areas of high transmission risk include the Lowveld of Mpumalanga, including the Kruger National Park and surrounds, and the northern KZN-Mozambique border,” the NICD said.

Travellers have been warned to look out for malaria symptoms such as fever, chills, sweats, headaches, nausea and vomiting, body aches and general malaise, and to report to their nearest health facility if they suspect that they may have contracted malaria.  eNCA
