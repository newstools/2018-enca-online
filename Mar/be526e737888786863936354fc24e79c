CENTURION - Attacking 80s by Heino Kuhn and Heinrich Klaasen capped a remarkable first day of action between the Titans and Knights in their decisive Sunfoil Series final round clash at SuperSport Park in Centurion on Saturday. With the opening two days of the round 10 encounter washed out, there were two declarations and three innings that were played out on what was day three. The clash had begun with the hosts winning the toss and inserting the visitors, who reached 169/7 before declaring after 40 overs. Luthando Mnyanda top-scored with 53 (94 balls, 8 fours), but it was the bowling that impressed more were Alfred Mothoa (3/34) and Malusi Siboto (2/39), sharing five of the wickets. The Titans then responded by scoring at almost seven to the over as they amassed 269/3 declared in the same number of overs. Kuhn blasted 86 (82 balls, 13 fours, 1 six), while Klaasen bludgeoned 84 not out (56 balls, 9 fours, 4 sixes). There was also 48 off 42 from Andrea Agathangelou as the home side took a 100-run lead. Chris Morris (2/14) then took two wickets without a run on the board as the Knights slumped to 0/2, before David Millerâ€™s unbeaten 36 helped them reach the close on 62/3, still trailing by 38. Both sides have to win the match to try and give themselves the best chance of catching the table-topping Warriors. African News Agency
