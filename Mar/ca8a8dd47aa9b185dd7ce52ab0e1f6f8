JOHANNESBURG - In response to too many controversies around womanhood, what it means to be a woman, the girl power slogan, and it’s influence in pop culture today, Liz Ogumbo probes how to be addressed as a woman and how she positions and represents who she is. Liz Ogumbo’s new single, ‘Whatchyu know about her?’ is soulfully created to redefine how woman are portrayed in society and how positive self-portrayal starts at home. The Kenyan-born artist and fashion designer says, “I believe music speaks louder than talk, so my new single is strictly about re-introducing the ‘Woman’ to this fast-evolving, pop-culture-driven society where blue is voted green and sometimes yellow, even when it is in fact blue” The multi-talented artist, sat down with eNCA’s Mbali Langa to chat about her new offering, Ken-Soul - The Lotus Chapter. eNCA
