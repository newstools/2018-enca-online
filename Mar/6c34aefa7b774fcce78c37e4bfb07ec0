NDOLA – Zambia Bafana Bafana coach Stuart Baxter was left satisfied after his team notched up a 2-0 win over hosts Zambia in the final of the Four Nations tournament, played at the Levy Mwanawasa Stadium in Ndola on Saturday. Goals from Percy Tau and Lebohang Mothiba separated the sides. Baxter hailed his troops after the match. “I wish it was easy, when the game started, we obviously knew the first 20 minutes would be important because Zambia was going to be on the front foot. “We didn’t want to concede early and because they were on the front foot, we talked about our transition play.” Despite the 2-0 scoreline, Baxter said it was a tight contest which needed the best from his team to ensure victory.

The coach has done good job with Zambia, they were lively. In the second half, they pushed us back and pushed a lot of players forward,” explained Baxter. Baxter, however, was again critical of his side's lack of converting opportunities into goals. "I thought we were not clinical enough to convert chances from our transition, but I am delighted with the character of the team, especially the young ones over the last two games."
