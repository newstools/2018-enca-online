It is an instrument for facilitating electoral participation, which is placed at the disposal of political parties for campaign purposes. It serves a functional purpose as a planning tool for accurate provision of electoral material and the avoidance of electoral fraud.” Here's what you need to know: Can't visit your correct voting station on the #RegWeekend of 10 & 11 March?
