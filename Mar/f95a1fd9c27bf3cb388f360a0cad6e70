JOHANNESBURG - Amnesty International has accused oil companies Royal Dutch Shell and Italian multinational Eni SPA of misleading Nigerian regulators over oil spills. A detailed report by the rights group shows that at least 89 spills may have been wrongly labelled as theft or sabotage instead of operational faults. Shell is responsible for 46 of these, while 43 are attributable to Eni.
