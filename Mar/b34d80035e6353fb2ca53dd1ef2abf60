JOHANNESBURG - Michelle Obama made a two-year-old fan's day, after dancing it up with the little girl. Obama reached out to Parker Curry, after a photograph of the toddler staring adoringly at the former first lady's portrait, went viral on social media. In a video posted on her Instagram account, Obama is seen having a 'dance party' with Curry. "Parker, I'm so glad I had the chance to meet you today (and for the dance party)! Keep on dreaming big for yourself... and maybe one day I'll proudly look up at a portrait of you!" Obama posted. Watch the video of the dance below.
