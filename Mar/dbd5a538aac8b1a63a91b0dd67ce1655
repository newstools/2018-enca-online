People took to twitter to question Heineken on the blatant racial insensitivity of the advert. Musical Grammy winner, Chance the Rapper, also slammed the advert on social media. He furthermore pointed out the marketing campaigns are deliberately producing racist adverts to get more views. This is a marking strategy called “outrage marketing”, which comes after numerous adverts by major brands like H&M and Dove. Heineken SA has since apologised and said that they “missed the mark” with the advert. The company explained that the reference to “light” was meant as an indication of the fewer calories in the beer. – Boniswa Khumalo eNCA
