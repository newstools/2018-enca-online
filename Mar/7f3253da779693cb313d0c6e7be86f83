JOHANNESBURG – Police minister, Bheki Cele says there’s no confirmation yet that an African National Congress (ANC) member’s murder was politically motivated. Nqobizwe Mkhize, a voting district coordinator on the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) South Coast, was gunned down in his home on Saturday. Two other community members, Nathi Hlengwa and Sibonelo Hlongwane, were gunned down a few kilometres away15 minutes later. Mkhize has been instrumental in driving the party’s campaign in his district, which is part of the eThekwini region. There has been a string of politically aligned killings in the province over the last years. The latest incident led a visit from the police minister, who had been campaigning in the province during the voter registration weekend. He addressed the community in a bid to reassure them.
