LUANDA, Angola – South Africa's SuperSport United played to a 0-0 draw with Petro Atletico in a CAF Confederations Cup first round, first leg tie, at the Estadio 11 de Novembro, Luanda, Angola, on Tuesday evening. It was SuperSport’s first game since Eric Tinkler quit his post as head coach, with the team temporarily being handled by assistant-coach Kaitano Tembo. The Pretoria club will be satisfied with the draw and will be keen to finish things off when they are at home for the second leg. SuperSport got into stride early on when a threatening cross from Siyabonga Nhlapo was dealt with by the Petro defence. Four minutes later, the South Africans had a great opportunity, but Aubrey Modiba fired his effort wide. Another chance followed, but Sipho Mbule skied his attempt over the bar. The best chance of the half also accrued to SuperSport when Modiba whipped in a cross, but Teboho Mokoena’s header flashed agonisingly wide. With neither team able to break the deadlock, it was goalless at the break. Things remained tight in the second half, though the Angolans were a bit more dominant. Petro should, in fact, have scored in the 60th minute, but SuperSport goalkeeper Reyaad Pieterse pulled off a stunning save to deny the home side. SuperSport changed tactics in a bid to make sure their defence wasn’t breached by making two substitutions, bringing on defender Onismor Bhasera in place of attacker Darren Smith, and Luke le Roux coming in for Mbule. Ten minutes before full-time, after a sweet counter-attack, Modiba created an opening after losing his man with some great skill out wide, but he shot flashed wide of goal. However, the South Africans had a lucky escape four minutes before the close when Petro hit the post. In the end, though, neither team managed to score and goalless was how it finished.
