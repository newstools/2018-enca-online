WARSAW, Poland – Kenyans stole the show in the men's and women's races at the 13th edition of the PZU Warsaw Half Marathon on Sunday. It was a double victory for the African country as Ezrah Sang and Pauline Njeru won in 1:01:37 and 1:10:02 respectively. Sang, one of the pre-race favourites, attacked three kilometres from the finish to run away from Kassa Mekashaw of Ethiopia, with Hillary Maiyo, a regular on Polish roads, taking third place. Kenyans Ezrah Kiprotich Sang and Polline Wanjiku Njeru on Sunday emerged the champions of the 2018 Warsaw Half Marathon held in Poland.

After having lost all her rivals just after the halfway point, she was never in danger of being caught. Birhan Mihretu and Marege Hayelom, both of Ethiopia, followed her home in second and third. Back in the men's race, a four-man leading group emerged at the front but eventually, the race was decided some two kilometres later when the Kenyan decided to make a decisive move. Mekashaw had no response as Sang continued moving away until the finish and broke the tape after 1:01:37, scoring a victory in his first ever outing in Poland. In a close battle for the next three places, El Hassan Oubaddi of Morocco, second last week in Gdynia, came through for fourth in 1:02:52. Abel Rop of Kenya followed in 1:02:57. African News Agency
