JOHANNESBURG - Vodacom Bulls coach John Mitchell named an unchanged squad to face the Emirates Lions in their Vodacom Super Rugby clash at Loftus Versfeld on Saturday. The Bulls opened their campaign with a 21-19 win over the Hurricanes last weekend and the same 23 players will again take the field for this Jukskei derby. “The guys really showed a lot of courage last weekend, but that is what you expect from a Vodacom Bulls player. More encouraging to me was the belief shown by the guys in how we wanted to execute and play the game. You need to trust the process and each other and that was what happened,” Mitchell explained. Bulls captain, Burger Odendaal, feels that another step-up is needed against the Emirates Lions, who topped the tournament log in 2017.

This will be a typical derby with no favours asked or extended and we are all looking forward to this game. We have the advantage of the match being played at Loftus Versfeld and we urge our fans to come out in numbers to support. We are playing for them as much as we are playing for ourselves as a squad.” Lions coach Swys de Bruin said: “We are preparing well, we want to ask our supporters to join us there. We want to see our red and white (colours). We want to make a difference and play some attractive rugby there.” READ: Mapoe on the double for victorious Lions over Sharks Bulls team: 15 Divan Rossouw, 14 Travis Ismaiel, 13 Jesse Kriel, 12 Burger Odendaal (co-captain), 11 Johnny Kotze, 10 Handre Pollard, 9 Andre Warner, 8 Hanro Liebenberg, 7 Thembelani Bholi, 6 Roelof Smit, 5 Lood de Jager, 4 RG Snyman, 3 Frans van Wyk, 2 Jaco Visagie, 1 Pierre Schoeman.
