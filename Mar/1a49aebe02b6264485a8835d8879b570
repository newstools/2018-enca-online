We’re proud to announce our RICH MNISI NWA-MULAMULA collectible furniture project in partnership with @southernguildgallery. Our furniture debut, consists of a chaise and a stool, after my late great-grand mother which represents a guardian and stands a physical representation of Nwa-Mulamula as the ever-present guardian, whose teachings live on through storytelling generation after generation. The chaise, which takes the shape of Nwa-Mulamula’s (The Guardian) body in the form of a Navy leather couch, presents her presence and long-lasting teachings, and the stool, in the shape of an eye with gold puddles, represents her tears, which were never in vain. Without her pain and her experiences I wouldn’t exist. I wouldn’t be the person I am today... These pieces form part of a group show of multidisciplinary artists, all in celebration of Southern Guild’s decade-long journey of pioneering collectible design in South Africa, and include ceramic artists Zizipho Poswa and Madoda Fani, sculptors Daniella Mooney and Stanislaw Trzebinski, and newcomers such as 3D illustrator Ferdi B Dick. The exhibition will run until April 16th, 2018 #nwamulamula #richmnisi A post shared by  RICH MNISI (@rich_mnisi) on eNCA
