SOWETO - eNCA.com's Masechaba Mogane interviewed one of the Soweto CookOut Sunday founder Keletso Ramela about the taste fest. IN PICTURES: The Cookout Sunday How different is CookOut Sunday this year? Ramela: CookOut Sunday is different this year because we are going to be hosting only four events which means it will now be (quarterly). We feel this will give us the chance to plan and execute better and also better refine the business model. What new flavour did you add to CookOut Sunday?
	 
	Ramela: Our new flavour is "What's your next?" by that I mean, yes, you guessed right, Standard Bank. We will be working with them over the next few of our events with the aim to finesse and bring more innovation to the event. Look out for some exciting features in the next coming events. We can't reveal anything at this stage as we are still in the planning phase. What are the things people can look forward to when coming to CookOutSunday?
	 
	Ramela: People can look forward to a) a safe family environment; b) great culinary experience; c) beautiful ambience; d) affordable prices on food and beverages; e) great entertainment; Ramela: The aim of CookOut Sunday has always been to stand out as a food event. By so doing, this gives us the opportunity to play a role in the township economic space. As an event, we have helped create up to 500 job opportunities with everyone from food vendors to ordinary members of the community benefiting from each event. We plan and aim to grow these numbers. eNCA
