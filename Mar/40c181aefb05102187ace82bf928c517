JOHANNESBURG – The Steel and Engineering Industries Federation of Southern Africa (Seifsa) wants urgent intervention from the government on new US tariffs, due to kick in next week. It warns that it will hurt the local economy. On Thursday, US President Donald Trump imposed a 25-percent tariff on steel imports and 10-percent on aluminium. READ: Trump says US to impose steel, aluminum tariffs next week Nearly 2 percent of US steel imports came from South Africa last year. The federation says it wants the Trade and Industry Department to reject the new tariffs. Kaizer Nyatsumba, the CEO of Seifsa said: “We are not among the biggest importers, exporters of aluminium and steel so I don’t understand the rationale why we are being targeted as a country. So we believe that it is important for a direct engagement to take place to seek to understand the rationale from the point of view of Trump administration, And to argue that South Africa should be excluded from that basket of countries that were affected.” eNCA
