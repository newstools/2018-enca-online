We have been using the agreement that was struck between former President Jacob Zuma and the government as the instrument that has enabled the government to help pay the money. On the understanding that the money will be paid back if he is found to be personally responsible for these acts.” READ: NPA makes decision on Zuma prosecution Ramaphosa elaborated on the agreement between Zuma and the state regarding the former President's legal costs. “According to information from the Department of Justice government has contributed R15, 3 million to the personal legal costs since 2006.
