EFF leader, Julius Malema wants Jonas to replace Nelson Mandela Bay mayor Athol Trollip. WATCH: Malema tells DA to go to hell This is in retaliation for DA MPs voting against land expropriation without compensation. “Motions in Parliament can just be slogans that's the main problem because we need to talk about a programme of redress and economic justice in the country. It might be attractive but if you think about it, the interconnection between land, financial sector and a range of other things you realise you need a more in-depth approach to the question and address the fundamental,” said Jonas. “The fundamental issue being we do need land and asset redistribution programme that is more robust than it has been now but equally that has been managed very well without undermining other aspects of the economy,” he added. eNCA
