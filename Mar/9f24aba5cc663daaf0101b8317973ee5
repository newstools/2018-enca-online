JOHANNESBURG - On Wednesday, South Africans commemorated Human Rights Day, this in memory of the 69 black people who died at the hands of the police on 21 March 1960 in Sharpeville. The anti-pass march was a demonstration led by the PAC to seek the end to pass laws. Controversial businesswoman Magda Wierzycka, tweeted a picture to commemorate the events of the day with an inappropriate picture of Hector Pieterson, showing an event that took place almost two decades later in 1976. Wierzycka's error in remembering South African history led to corrections and slanderous comments in response to her post. She later apologised for the mistake. Just a few days ago, Wierzycka deleted a post on Twitter, which she claimed was a mere suggestion with regards to the alarming rate of unemployment in South Africa. She said, “I often get asked‚ how can I help SA? Our biggest challenge = job creation. "A thought: let every household employ just 1 more cleaning lady or gardener. Just 1. I know it’s a financial sacrifice. But we all need to sacrifice if we are to save SA. Imagine the impact.” Twitter, however,  made light of her latest error by starting a hashtag #MagdaWierzyckaChallenge. It was in similar fashion to the recent #MarkFishChallenge, where he used an incorrect picture to honour the passing of music icon Hugh Masekela.
