CAPE TOWN - Justice Minister Michael Masutha says he wasn't involved in negotiations over a multimillion-rand golden handshake for former prosecutions head Mxolisi Nxasana. Masutha spoke during a question and answer session in Parliament. "I'm not party to any of the proceedings between the president and the current director of prosecutions and Mr Nxasana or any other party relating to this matter," said Masutha.

Masutha said that at no stage in his conversations with Nxasana or the former president had the issue of Zuma's possible prosecution arisen. Nxasana has told the North Gauteng High Court he was forced from his position. He disputed former president Jacob Zuma’s version that he had left at his own request. Nxasana said Zuma had lied under oath about how he left his position as South Africa’s most powerful prosecutor. eNCA
