LONDON - Celtic captain Scott Brown is to be rewarded for his sterling service to the Scottish giants with a testimonial match against a Republic of Ireland XI, his club announced on Monday. The 32-year-old midfielder is on course for an eighth league crown in 11 seasons at Celtic having joined from Hibernian in 2007. Brown, capped 55 times by Scotland, is to donate part of the revenue from the match -- which will take place at Celtic Park on May 20, the day after the Scottish Cup final -- to charities and to the family of former Ireland and Celtic player Liam Miller, who died aged just 36 of cancer last month. "When I became Celtic manager, I ensured one of my first jobs was to meet Scott, as we discussed our plans for the future," Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers told the club website. "He is a hugely important figure at the club and someone who I have been privileged to work with. "With a tremendous will to succeed in everything he does, he is someone who we know we can depend on, someone you want in your team and a man who has been the most influential player in Scottish football for some time."
