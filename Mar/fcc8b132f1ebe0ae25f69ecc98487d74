JOHANNESBURG – Analysts expect the South African Reserve Bank to cut interest rates next week. This follows better-than-expected consumer inflation figures that were released on Tuesday morning. Lower food and fuel prices saw inflation continue with its downward trend to a two-year low. It slowed from 4,4 percent in January to 4 percent in February. A lower inflationary outlook supports the case for monetary policy easing. Economic Strategist Tumisho Grater says this gives the central bank an opportunity to cut rates though the bank will also be looking at the rand's performance. WATCH: Interest rate kept the same “They [Reserve bank] did flag credit rating risks as the reasons they held off cutting interest rates – International oil prices being higher is also a factor,” continued Grater. “But we had a strong rand which cushioned that – so those two factors – and the fact that we had a strong budget... could possibly cut interest rates next week.” eNCA
