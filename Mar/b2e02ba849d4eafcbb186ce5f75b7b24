JOHANNESBURG – South Africans are very familiar with puppets providing adults with entertainment riddled with political commentary. Think Chester Missing or ZANews' Puppet Nation. But a puppet musical? The Broadway musical, AVENUE Q, won three coveted Tony Awards in 2004: for Best Book, Best Score and Best Musical. Now this production – described as "equal parts puppetry, comedy and catchy tunes" – is headed for Johannesburg. READ: TAP DOGS, the 'hottest show on legs' heads to SA The show is a comedy-musical telling the story of a university graduate, Princeton who moves into a shabby New York flat. He and his neighbours face the universal struggle of graduates: getting jobs, finding love, making money and the meaning of life. AVENUE Q uses humour and music to touch on complex and adult topics like sexuality, racism, and pornography. The South African premiere will be directed and choreographed by Timothy le Roux, with musical direction by Dawid Boverhoff. Kosie Smit is tasked with puppet creation as well as scenic design. According to Le Roux, the South African cast was put through its paces during auditions. "In musical theatre jargon, the term ‘triple threat’ is often used to describe a person who is good at acting, singing and dancing. What makes this piece of theatre unique is that it includes all that - plus puppetry skills, which requires intensive training for our actors.” The cast includes: Ashleigh Harvey as Kate Monster/Lucy, Clive Gilson as Princeton/Rod, Daniel Geddes as Nicky/Trekkie Monster, Grant Towers as Brian, Yamikani Mahaka-Phiri as Gary Coleman, Rebecca Hartle as Christmas Eve, Nieke Lombard as Bad Idea Bear, Graeme Wicks as Bad Idea Bear and Songezo Khumalo will fulfill various understudy roles. AVENUE Q is on stage at the Pieter Toerien Theatre at Monte Casino from May 9 to July 15. eNCA
