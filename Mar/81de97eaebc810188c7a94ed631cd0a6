JOHANNESBURG – Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene says South Africa’s economic growth forecast look positive. Nene was addressing the Federations of Unions of South Africa conference in Pretoria on Monday. He says it's likely to be revised upwards by the time the medium-term budget outlook is announced in October. READ: Gigaba's budget might not be enough to stop credit downgrade: Nene “The increase in our growth and the revision by how much, it is not possible to tell you by how much at the moment. I was saying, the prospects look good but we are likely to see an improvement in our growth forecast. But it is not possible to say, until we have seen exactly the direction we are taking. And we are working very hard to achieve that.” Nene said the government was committed to “finalising many outstanding policy reforms such as the Mining Charter; act decisively against corruption in the public and private sectors and swiftly resolve governance and operational failures at SOEs in particular Eskom.” eNCA
