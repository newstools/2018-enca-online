NEW YORK - One of the foremost private collections of works by the influential Irish writer James Joyce has been donated to New York's Morgan Library and Museum. The 350-piece collection includes numerous signed and inscribed first editions, photographs, posters and manuscripts, including a fragment of his magnum opus "Ulysses" and rare pressings of 78 RPM recordings of the author.

"It is difficult to summarize in a few words the importance of this extraordinary gift to the Morgan Library & Museum," said museum director Colin Bailey. "It adds enormously to our small but distinguished Joyce collection, and instantly establishes the Morgan as a major centre for scholarly research related to the authorâ€™s life and work." The museum is planning a public exhibition in 2022, the centennial of the publication of "Ulysses." Joyce's life and works are also commemorated at the James Joyce Center in Dublin and in a collection at the University of Buffalo. The Morgan Library is the former private library of John Pierpont "JP" Morgan, a central figure in the world of finance at the turn of the 20th century. It was opened to the public by his son following his death and has since become a museum focused on literature. AFP
