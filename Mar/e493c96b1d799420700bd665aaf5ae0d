PARLIAMENT – Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry on Friday said it's still probing what legal power it has to have Ford Kugas removed from South African roads. This is after several vehicles from car manufacturer caught fire. Last year, Ford SA announced a massive recall of some of its Kuga models. Parliament said the National Consumer Commission (NCC) is still busy with the inquiry. According to Parliament, the committee heard from the NCC about fears and concerns experienced by people in South Africa that the Ford Kuga was redirected from markets where it was recalled and dumped in South Africa. The committee called on the NCC to provide a written clarification on this allegation. WATCH: Ford announces Kuga recall “We will establish what legal powers Parliament has to request these vehicles removed from our roads,” said the committee's chairperson, Joanmariae Fubbs. Fubbs has also requested an explanation for the reasons why the Kugas were allowed to remain on South African roads. “We should not just accept the safety specifications of the European Union. We should be able to say we are a sovereign country and should be looking into developing our own safety regulations. These cars have been removed from the roads in United States, so why are we still allowing them here?” she said. The committee has also urged the National Regulator for Compulsory Specifications to develop local specifications to ensure vehicles manufactured in foreign countries are suitable for South Africa’s terrain and climate. eNCA
