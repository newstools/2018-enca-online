JOHANNESBURG – The self-declared Libyan National Army (LNA), led by strongman Khalifa Hafter, has commenced airstrikes in the south of the country after giving “foreigners” and “Africans” a 10-day ultimatum to leave the North African country. During it’s first operation the LNA reported on Tuesday that it had targeted 10 armed vehicles allegedly belonging to Chadian opposition militias south of the Harouj (Harouge) mountains in the middle of the Libyan desert. Chadian opposition militias have been reported to have been operating in Libya since mid-2014.

At the beginning of the month the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) expressed its concerns over growing violence and the safety of civilians in Sebha following fighting between the Tebus and the Awlad Sulieman tribes.
