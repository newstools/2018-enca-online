JOHANNESBURG - The Nation Union of Metalworkers (Numsa) is demanding that government raise the national minimum wage. The union said government and the private sector need to work together to stop the exploitation of workers. It warned workers not to let their rights be trampled upon. Numsa has held discussions around the national minimum wage, proposed changes to the Labour Relations Act and other labour laws it worries will limit workers' rights. #NUMSA General Secretary Irvin Jim takes to the podium and he says workers are under siege in South Africa. pic.twitter.com/JALLJ7z81W #NUMSA Jim says the current National Minimum Wage is flawed. #LabourMovement pic.twitter.com/A9AR2xpHxu The much anticipated national minimum wage is due to come into effect in May. Numsa said the move, which government describes as a game changer, will not address the plight of workers. Numsa believes the R3,500 monthly minimum wage is not sustainable. #NUMSA and other organizations say right to strike is non-negotiable. #LabourMovement pic.twitter.com/wigaBX0Xwj “You have given ordinary workers a minimum of R20 per hour. You speak about how domestic workers should earn R15 per hour, farmworkers R18 per hour and EPDWP (extended Public Works programme) workers R11 an hour. This is really an insult,” said the union's spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi Majola.
