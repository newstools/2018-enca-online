HARARE, Zimbabwe – ICC Chief Executive David Richardson on Monday congratulated Afghanistan and the West Indies for making it through to the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019. He also thanked Zimbabwe Cricket, their volunteers and the ICC staff for putting together a successful ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier 2018, which concluded in Harare on Sunday. Afghanistan and the Windies qualified for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019, to be played from May 30 to July 14 in England and Wales, after finishing as the top two sides after 33 matches in the 10-team qualifying tournament. In the 34th and final match of the tournament on Sunday, Afghanistan beat the West Indies by seven wickets with a competent display in the field and with the bat to lift the prestigious silverware. “On behalf of the ICC, I want to congratulate Afghanistan for their efforts in recovering from a slow start to take this prestigious title and, both them and the West Indies for qualifying for the ICC Cricket Word Cup 2019. "We look forward to welcoming them along with the eight top-ranked ODI teams in England and Wales for what I’m sure will be highly-competitive event,” said Richardson, who attended Sunday’s final in Harare. The qualification process for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 was a rigorous one which started way back in 2013 with 94 members below the Test members taking part in various ICC World Cricket League Division events.
