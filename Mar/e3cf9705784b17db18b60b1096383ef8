JOHANNESBURG - Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema has told his supporters to prepare themselves to take over land. The EFF leader was speaking at the launch of the party’s voter registration campaign in Johannesburg on Sunday. WATCH: Malema tells DA to go to hell “Stop smoking nyaope, land is coming. We don’t want land to find you finished by nyaope and alcohol. We want fit people like me, you can see me," he said. "We must go and work on the land, the land is coming, land will be given to Africans. South Africans must be equipped with tools to work on lands. Land is coming back, Africa is coming,” said Malema. The EFF has called for expropriation of land without compensation. On Tuesday, MPs agreed to the EFF's motion to expropriate land without compensation as long as it does not not threaten food security and economic growth. eNCA
