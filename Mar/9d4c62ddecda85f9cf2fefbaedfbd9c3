JOHANNESBURG – An attacking century by Dane Vilas put the Dolphins in a strong position at the halfway stage of their Sunfoil Series encounter against the Highveld Lions at the Bidvest Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg on Friday. The right-hander completed his 16th career ton as the visitors closed on 318/7 in reply to the 246 of the hosts – a lead of 72. Vilas, playing as on opener in the absence of Morne van Wyk, went on to record 128 (152 balls, 19 balls, 1 six) to lead a strong reply by the KwaZulu-Natal side. Senuran Muthusamy provided good support for the veteran wicketkeeper with 69 (160 balls, 8 fours), while there were useful 40s from Vaughn van Jaarsveld (42) and Calvin Savage (46 not out). Beuran Hendricks (3/61) and Aaron Phangiso (3/62) picked up three wickets apiece for the Lions, who earlier failed to add much to their overnight score of 207/7. Mangaliso Mosehle ended with 42 and Sean Jamison (22 not out), with debutants Okuhle Cele (3/19) and Ethan Bosch (3/43) the best of the bowlers with three wickets each. African News Agency
