"I agree with human rights activists and I know about human rights, but for me, that’s where I draw the line. You now become an animal and we need to treat you like an animal if you behave like an animal. We will treat people like people if they behave like people," said Cele. The new police minister is known for not mincing his words. He has previously told the police they must shoot to kill if their lives are in danger. He was national police commissioner at the time. eNCA
