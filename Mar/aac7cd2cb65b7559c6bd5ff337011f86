Noor at that age very strong minded, strong willed, very clear of what they want, what they see, clear of the circumstances inside Ghouta and all of Syria," said Imtiaz Sooliman, Gift of the Givers Director. Sooliman said the girls are pleased that they are safe but sad at the same time. "They are very pleased that they are coming to safety but also very sad. When we spoke to her two days ago she spoke to the Yemeni guy and she told him all our lives we've lived in Ghouta. We don't have family outside Ghouta, where we gonna go to, stay, do," said Sooliman.
