LIMA,Â Peru - The South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) announced Tuesday that it had asked the current president, Paraguay's Alejandro Dominguez, to stand again in elections to be held on May 11. CONMEBOL's board met on Monday and said it was seeking to give "continuity and to deepen the development of South American football," and its "operational, legal, financial and commercial support." The board gave Dominguez its backing "to present his candidacy for the presidency in order to consolidate the reforms that his administration has been leading, with the aim of institutionalising, professionalising and making transparent South American football." The confederation is facing major challenges, including managing the bidding rights to its main club tournaments for the 2019-2022 seasons -- the Copa Libertadores, Copa Sudamericana and Recopa -- as well as the organisation of the 2019 Copa America in Brazil. In the May 11 elections, the confederation will elect a president, three vice-presidents and a delegate to represent CONMEBOL at world football authority FIFA. FIFA President Gianni Infantino will chair an executive summit of the global body in Lima on Wednesday. AFP
