The prosecuting authority appeared before the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa). The NPA was expected to make an announcement on the prosecution of former President Jacob Zuma on Thursday. However, it now says it first has to inform relevant stakeholders of its decision before making the decision public. On Wednesday, the Constitutional Court dismissed a bid to block Abarahams from announcing his decision. The application was brought by the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution. Casac argued it would be inappropriate for Abrahams to make this decision, given the uncertainty about  Abarahams' future in his job. On December 15, North Gauteng Judge President Dunstan Mlambo ruled that Abrahams' appointment was questionable. The court gave then-deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa two months to appoint a new NPA head. Zuma and the NPA appealed the ruling.
