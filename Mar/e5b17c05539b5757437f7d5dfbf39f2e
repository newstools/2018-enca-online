JOHANNESBURG – The organisers of the upcoming South African Film and Television Awards (Saftas) said nominations for the controversial movie Inxeba (The Wound) stand despite the Films and Publication Board (FPB) Appeals Tribunal reclassifying the movie in the same category as hardcore porn. The film was nominated for eight awards including that of Best Actor for the lead character played by musician Nakhane Toure. It also boasts 19 international awards. Safta organisers said they do not view the film as “porn”.

The film orchestrates a dynamic examination of sexuality, masculinity and the clash between traditional and contemporary African values. “The film's interrogation of toxic masculinity seemed to evoke cultural sensitivity based on the fictitious representation of the film. However, bringing this film to light is deemed an incredible experience for the Inxeba producers,” the Safta organisers said. #Inxeba -> The South African Screen Federation joins the legal fight in support of the film.

The FPB had given Inxeba a rating of 16LS but after complaints from traditional leaders and cultural groups, the FPB’s Appeals Tribunal overturned the classification and rated the film X18, the same category as hardcore porn. The film was then removed from cinemas but producers are fighting the ruling in court. The 12th annual Saftas will be held in Sun City on March 22. eNCA
