PORT ELIZABETH - The St George's brass band were asked to quiet the horns by umpires on Saturday during the game between South Africa and Australia. READ: Rabada dismantles Aussies Umpire Kumar Dharmasena told the band to be quiet after he reportedly could not hear the edges. St George’s brass band has played at the park for twenty years. It's not the first time the band has clashed with umpires. In 2016, ICC referee David Boon silenced the group in a match between South Africa and Sri Lanka. Keep playing lads. Loud and proud. #SAvAUS pic.twitter.com/jrC1bcvnTv Umpire Dharmasena won’t allow play to continue while the band play (having just returned). What a joke. #SAvAUS pic.twitter.com/T85yiYANDn The band is back
		The umpires have stopped play
		We have ourselves a stand off@SENNews Band stopped play...no really.
		
		A brass band in Port Elizabeth have caused delays in Saturday's play, were thrown out and then readmitted as South Africa chase down Australia's first innings total.
		
		They're back and playing...for now, much to the delight of the fans.#SAvAUS pic.twitter.com/vdwIOqULtj The band was briefly booted from the stadium before returning to entertain fans. eNCA
