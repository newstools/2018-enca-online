Itumeleng Khune replaced Darren Keet in the sticks, gaining his 87th cap for the national team. Bafana captain Thulani Hlatshwayo alongside Daniel Cardoso were paired central in the back with Innocent Maela and Ramahlwe Mphahlele operating at left and right back respectively. Teboho Mokoena replaced club teammate Dean Furman as the anchor-man with Siphesihle Ndlovu and Kamohelo Mokotjo right in front of him. French-based Keegan Dolly, who is quite familiar with the stadium from his Champions League experience with Mamelodi Sundowns, formed part of the attacking trio which included Sibusiso Vilakazi on the left and Percy Tau upfront.
