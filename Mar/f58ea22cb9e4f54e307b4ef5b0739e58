JOHANNESBURG – Glencore is expanding its footprint on the global coal market. It agreed to buy Australian coal mine Rio Tinto’s Hail Creek unit for $1,7 billion (R203-billion). The acquired mine produces coking coal for steel as well as thermal coal for power stations. The deal will help expand Glencore’s coal operations in Australia, where it bought a 49 percent stake in Asian-owned Yancoal Hunter Valley mines last year.
