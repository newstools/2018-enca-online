JOHANNESBURG - German software firm SAP has admitted it paid almost R130-million to win contracts from state-owned enterprises. This emerged after an external legal investigation into the company's dealings with Gupta-owned companies. The technology firm says staff members implicated in the contracts have since resigned, without receiving severance packages. Employees at the firm will no longer receive sales commission on any public sector contracts.
