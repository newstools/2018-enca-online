CAPE TOWN - The Democratic Alliance (DA) will report Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema to the Equality Court for hate speech following his verbal attack on Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor Athol Trollip. "The DA condemns in the strongest terms the comments made by EFF Leader, Julius Malema, that we are going to remove a mayor of PE… We are going for your white man in PE. We are going to cut the throat' referring to Trollip", the party's national spokesperson Refiloe Nt’sekhe said on Thursday. She said Malema’s statements were "nothing short of hate speech and go as far as an incitement to violence". "While these kinds of vile and bigoted statements have come to characterise the EFF and its leader, they have no place in South Africa."

Malema has taken aim at Trollip in what he termed a "warning shot" to the DA for failing to support land expropriation without compensation. African News Agency
