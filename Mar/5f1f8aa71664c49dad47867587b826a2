But I don't think we should be too downhearted about it.” “He's brought us back up, you know we are second in the league. At the end of the day, we are going to have ups and downs. It was disappointing to be knocked out of the Champions League, but when you get to this stage of the competition, if you have a bad game you get knocked out, it's simple as that.

I was a footballer for 22 years and it still makes me unbelievably proud to have achieved what I did with United and of course being given the opportunity to captain my country.”  The English superstar recently celebrated being awarded ownership of an MLS franchise based Miami, Florida after a four-year wait.
