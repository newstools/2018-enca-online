JOHANNESBURG – First National Bank (FNB) is now a complete insurer. This is after the Financial Services Board (FSB) granted the bank a short-term licence to operate as an insurer. The bank will now underwrite short and long-term insurance to businesses and retail customers. The licence will allow the bank to compete with insurance companies in the short-term space for products like vehicle, travel and business insurance. READ: Twitter asks FNB: How can we help you?
