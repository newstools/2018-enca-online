JOHANNESBURG - Sanlam completed the cash placing of 65.5 million new ordinary shares in the company with institutional investors on Wednesday, at a price of R87 per placing share. The aim is to raise R5.7-billion. The placing was conducted via an accelerated book-building process.

The placing shares will also be listed on the Namibian Stock Exchange, subject to approval by that exchange. READ: Sanlam to buy PineBridge East Africa Sanlam said the net proceeds would be used partly to fund the group's acquisition of the remaining 53.37 percent shareholding in SAHAM Finances (SAHAM) announced earlier this month. SAHAM is the largest insurer in Africa outside South Africa and is the market leader in most of the 26 countries in which it operates in North, West and East Africa. Sanlam owns 58.48 percent of SAHAM Assurance Morocco, which is listed on the Casablanca Stock Exchange. The transaction is subject to the fulfillment of a number of conditions, including regulatory approvals, and is expected to conclude in the third quarter of 2018. Sanlam group CEO Ian Kirk said the acquisition of 100 percent of SAHAM would enable Sanlam to have an even more meaningful presence across sub-Saharan and North Africa. "The success of this placing indicates the significant investor confidence in Sanlam following a long period of consistent delivery on our strategic priorities and is evidence of the renewed confidence in South Africa as well," Kirk said. "We believe our investment in SAHAM, once completed, will add value to all our stakeholders and it is a critical milestone in our centenary year as we look to sustain our growth and performance in the years ahead."
