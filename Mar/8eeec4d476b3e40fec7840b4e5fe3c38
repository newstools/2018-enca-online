JOHANNESBURG - The inquiry into whether former Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini should be held personally liable for the grants debacle, resumed on Monday. Last year, the Constitutional Court ordered a probe to investigate if she should be held personally accountable for the costs of the Sassa crisis while she was minister in the department. During her testimony last month, Dlamini evaded questions.

The inquiry heard the work streams were not only expensive but also irregular and ineffectual. Retired judge Barnard Ngoepe heared closing arguments on Monday, after which he will compile a report for the Constitutional Court to decide on Dlamini's fate. Communications Minister Nomvula Mokonyane said last week that Cabinet had confidence in an inter-ministerial committee working around the clock to ensure there were no disruptions in social grants payments on 1 April. The committee was polishing the contingency plan should the Constitutional Court reject the second Sassa court application to have the CPS contract extended by six months, she said. - Additional reporting ANA Tweets about #SASSAInquiry AND(FROM:@ermbates since:2018-03-19 until:2018-03-20) !function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+"://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,"script","twitter-wjs"); eNCA
