JOHANNESBURG â€“ Former Australian cricket captain Steve Smith in a tearful apology on Thursday took full responsibility for the ball-tampering scandal. The incident, which took place in the third Test between South Africa and Australia in Cape Town, was caught on camera. The scandal has rocked the cricket world. Fans on Twitter did not waste time expressing their shock and in some cases, delight, after seeing the former Aussie skipper in tears and utterly distraught at a media briefing in Sydney.
