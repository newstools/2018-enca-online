DURBAN - A blistering century by Gihahn Cloete lit up what was effectively the opening day of the crucial final-round Sunfoil Series encounter between the Dolphins and the Warriors in Durban on Saturday. In Durban, the @WarriorsCrickEC are doing the best they can to make up for lost time after finally getting their match underway a little later than usual today v @DolphinsCricket. They are 206/3 in 46 overs. @GihahnGG10 105 pic.twitter.com/3sDzsbcD40 But it was enough time for the visitors to reach 245/5 after they had lost the toss and were asked to bat first by the hosts. Opener Cloete smashed 105 (92 balls, 17 fours, 1 six) with captain Jon-Jon Smuts unbeaten on 38 at the close. Senuran Muthusamy was the pick of the bowlers after bagging 3/50. The opening two days of the final round match were washed out by rain. The result of the clash is crucial to the destiny of the title, with the Warriors heading into the game top of the table and needing to win the game to all but assure themselves of the 2017/18 four-day crown. A draw or less will mean the champions will be determined by the results of the other two matches. African News Agency
