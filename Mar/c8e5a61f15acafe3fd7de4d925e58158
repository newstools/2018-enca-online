JOHANNESBURG - Bafana Bafana flew out to Lusaka on Tuesday ahead of the opening Four Nations Tournament in Zambia. The South Africans will kick off the event in the opening fixture against Angola at the Levy Mwanawasa Stadium. The later match will feature hosts Zambia against neighbours Zimbabwe. Bafana Bafana arrived in camp in Johannesburg on Sunday evening with some of the overseas players reporting for duty only on Monday. Coach Stuart Baxter believes the right blend of youth and experience will yield the desired result as the team prepares for the tournament. Speaking at a media briefing held at the team’s hotel on Monday, the Bafana mentor highlighted that a balanced mix of youth and experience would be key in the team’s performance as they plan to use the tournament to prepare for the 2019 Afcon qualifiers set to resume later this year. “We have one training session here at home today (Monday) in the afternoon before flying to Zambia tomorrow (Tuesday) morning which doesn’t really give us a lot of time.

Bafana Bafana had their only training session at the Orlando Stadium on Monday. The squad has a clean bill of health with the exception of Bidvest Wits defender, Buhle Mkhwanazi who has a slight hamstring injury which the medical team will monitor during the training session.
