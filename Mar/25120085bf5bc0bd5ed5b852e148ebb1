JOHANNESBURG - The DA intends filing papers in the North Gauteng High Court on Friday to stop the state from paying former president Jacob Zuma's legal fees. On Thursday, President Cyril Ramaphosa gave more clarity on the matter. Ramaphosa says the actions by Zuma in the criminal allegations against him took place while he was a government official, at both a provincial and then later at a national level.

The DA also wants Zuma to pay back the R15.3-million already spent paying his lawyers in other cases since he became president. DA federal executive chairperson, James Selfe, spoke to eNCA's Vuyo Mvoko about why the party believes it is "nonsensical and illegal" to let taxpayers cover Zuma's legal costs. eNCA
