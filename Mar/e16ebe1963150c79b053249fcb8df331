CAPE TOWN - EFF MPs Mbuyiseni Ndlozi and Floyd Shivambu were forced to leave Parliament on Wednesday after refusing to withdraw a remark that Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba is a liar. Gigaba had told journalists the day before that Atul Gupta was not a citizen of South Africa. WATCH: Gigaba on Gupta naturalisation Gigaba has been in the spotlight over the naturalisation of the Gupta family. He was supposed to appear in Parliament on Wednesday to answer questions, but was a no-show after calling in sick. The Independent Electoral Commission said on Wednesday that Atul Gupta was, in fact, registered to vote in South Africa. eNCA
