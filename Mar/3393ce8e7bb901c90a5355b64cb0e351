JOHANNESBURG - The rand was slightly firmer at midday on Wednesday after Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene expressed confidence that SA would stave off a ratings downgrade from Moody’s. Nene addressed investors in London and said he believed SA was telling a “credible” economic story‚ despite some questions relating to land expropriation. Moody’s will deliver its latest credit rating next week. Analysts said it was possible that Moody’s would refrain from cutting its rating to junk‚ after the national budget was favourably received. “We can see the positive rand sentiment creeping out the back door on a downgrade‚ as the rand continues to track any moves in the dollar‚” said TreasuryOne analyst Gerard van der Westhuizen.
