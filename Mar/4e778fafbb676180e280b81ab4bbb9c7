JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Premier David Makhura says those responsible for the disappearance of the deputy director of a Gauteng NGO will be severely dealt with. Nomawethu Kunene, ofÂ  West Rand NGO A Re Ageng Social, went missing in February after exposing corruption in a Sassa tender. "The police have been given a very clear directive they must do everything in their power to find the missing director. If there is any one of us responsible, I want to say to them they can't hide we will get them," says Makhura. eNCA
