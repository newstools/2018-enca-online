JOHANNESBURG - The ANC, led by secretary-general Ace Magashule, is set to brief the media on Thursday afternoon on recent political developments in the country. On Monday night President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a new cabinet. Ramaphosa said the changes were made while being conscious of the need to balance continuity and stability for the need of renewal, economic recovery and accelerated transformation. He said all ministries and departments will be retained until a review of them is done. READ: Who is David Mabuza? The governing party has also deployed several senior leaders to its headquarters Luthuli House. The ANC said those appointments follow a decision by the party's special National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting held last weekend to deploy several chairpersons of committees to Luthuli House. Former KwaZulu-Natal Premier Senzo Mchunu will head the ANC's organising subcommittee on a full-time basis while former police minister Fikile Mbalula has been appointed to lead the party’s elections machinery.

Parliament on Tuesday agreed to the Economic Freedom Fighter's motion to expropriate land without compensation but it said this must be done in a way that ensures food security, economic growth and radical economic transformation. The ANC tabled the amendments to the opposition party's motion. The media briefing is set to commence at 1 pm. eNCA
