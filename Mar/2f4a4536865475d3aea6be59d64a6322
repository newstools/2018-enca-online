KWAZULU NATAL - The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) has reported that five people have contracted rabies since December last year. Patients with the disease were recorded in Limpopo, Mpumalanga, KwaZulu Natal (two cases) and the Eastern Cape. READ:Â Rabies cases reported in Muldersdrift, Lanseria Another suspected case was reported in the Free State in December. The patient was exposed to a domestic cat before falling ill. In this case, laboratory confirmation was not possible due to the lack of appropriate specimens. Rabies in humans can be prevented through post-exposure prophylaxis. In the case of possible rabies exposure, the NICD recommends washing the wound thoroughly with soap and water and going to a healthcare facility for rabies assessment as soon as possible. Rabies preventative treatment includes a series of rabies vaccination and the administration of rabies immunoglobulin. The six reported rabies cases involved exposure to rabid domestic dogs (three cases) and domestic cats (three cases). Other animals may also become infected with and transmit the virus to humans, but such reports are less common. The rabies virus is present in the saliva of the affected animal and may be transmitted to humans through bites, scratches or other wounds that break the skin and allow the infected saliva to enter the body. More information on rabies post -xposure prophylaxis is available from the NICD website. eNCA
