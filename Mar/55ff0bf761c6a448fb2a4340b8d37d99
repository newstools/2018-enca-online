RUSTENBURG - A criminal case has been opened against the head of the North West Department of Health, Dr Thabo Lekalakala. The legislature's Portfolio Committee on Health and Social Development said on Monday. "I opened the case against the HOD, not against the premier [Supra Mahumapelo]," a member of the province's portfolio committee on health and social development, Motlalepula Rosho, said. "It is a fraud and corruption case relating to the Buthelezi ambulance. This is according to the committee resolution that a case must be opened, it is a separate case. It is not related to Mediosa," she said.
