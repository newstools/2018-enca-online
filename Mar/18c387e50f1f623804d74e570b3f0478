CAPE TOWN - RCL Foods said in a statement on Friday that its Wolwehoek polony plant in the Free State, one of those identified as a possible source of the listeriosis outbreak, is clear of the ST6 listeria strain which was implicated in the outbreak. RCL Foods said, "Tests conducted by an independent laboratory in France, which is considered to be a leading expert in this field, have shown that the plant is clear of the ST6 listeria strain. "Rainbow polony products from the Wolwehoek plant were recalled as a precautionary measure and the plant has been temporarily closed. The recall does not affect any other RCL Foods facilities or products, including fresh and frozen Rainbow chicken."
