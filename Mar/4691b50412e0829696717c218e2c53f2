JOHANNESBURG - Eskom is to sign long-delayed agreements with independent producers for renewable energy next week, Energy Minister Jeff Radebe announced. The 27 renewable energy projects would create more than 61,000 new jobs and enable R56-billion of new investment in the economy, he said in a statement. Eskom has been stalling on payment of the projects, despite former president Jacob Zuma having announced two years ago that the projects would go ahead.
