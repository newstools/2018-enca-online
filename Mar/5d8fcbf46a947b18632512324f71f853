I felt I played some of my best tennis down on those breakpoints. “I think that first-set tie-break was really key. I did very well to reset (in the second set0, break him straight back at 4-all to go 5-4, and then played a good service game to serve it out.” Anderson, the 2014 runner-up there, served 18 aces and retained a strong focus when the pressure mounted late in the second set.
