JOHANNESBURG - Over 12 wheelchair tennis players from various regions in Gauteng will assemble at Arthur Ashe Tennis Centre in Soweto on Sunday, for a one-day Performance League geared towards continuing the culture of competitiveness within the province. The event is aimed at improving and increasing the level of play and knowledge of the most promising and upcoming tennis stars and to ensure entry into the possible upcoming major tournaments in the near future. Jabavu residents will have the opportunity to witness top class wheelchair tennis action on their doorstep as some of the best local junior players will be battling it out at Arthur Ashe – with free access for all spectators. Wheelchair Tennis South Africa (WTSA)’s Development Managers Patrick Selepe and Archie Lemeko will manage the performance league. “This is going to be another exciting event and a great opportunity for players within Gauteng to go head-to-head against each other,” said Selepe. “We have realised that one of the major contributing factors to our players’ success at the national level is more competition and training time within the regions and provincial level, this also gives coaches an opportunity to work together.” African News Agency
