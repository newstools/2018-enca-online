Australia have picked the same team for the seventh successive test and although it appears to be a bowlers' morning, Smith took the long view of not having to bat last on what is traditionally a pitch that aids reverse swing. "There is a little bit of grass on it and it might do a little bit this morning, but if we can get through that and post a big first innings total then reverse swing becomes important later on," Smith said at the toss.
