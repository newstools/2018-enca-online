JOHANNESBURG - Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela said on Monday he was "delighted" to get to the next round of the Nedbank Cup after knocking out Stellenbosch FC 2-1 to progress to the quarterfinals over the weekend. “It wasn’t a walk in the park,” Komphela admitted. “Stellenbosch came out and really made a fight of it. However, before their goal, we had a couple of chances to bury the match, including Teenage Hadebe’s header. That was a clear-cut chance, but we failed to finish from close range.” READ: Chiefs stutter to a draw against stubborn AmaZulu Bernard Parker and Castro formed a good combination up-front with the Colombian scoring the second goal. “There were a lot of positives to build on,” Komphela said, “even Castro’s goal came from Parker’s touch. “We will take this win to the next match, because after a win one goes to the next match with less pressure.” Chiefs host AmaZulu in a league fixture at FNB Stadium on Saturday (start at 6pm). Steve Barker, meanwhile, heaped praises on Man-of-the-Match, Daniel Cardoso. “Cardoso was fantastic tonight,” the Stellenbosch coach pointed out. “No wonder that Chiefs have conceded so few goals this season, as they are very tight and well organised in defence.” Komphela is looking forward to Thursday’s draw for the Nedbank Cup quarterfinal. “For now,  we will enjoy this win while staying grounded.” African News Agency
