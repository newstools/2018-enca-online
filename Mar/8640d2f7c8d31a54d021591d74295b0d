WATCH: MPs agree to EFF's motion on land expropriation, with amendments Taking the podium, EFF leader Julius Malema said the party won't back down from its stance on land expropriation without compensation. The EFF leader has threatened to unseat the DA in Nelson Mandela Bay because it opposes the idea. "We are not divorcing the DA, we are folding our arms. All white people who are angry, who have insulted us and mobilised some of your people in the media, all of you can go to hell!" he said. Malema said they have told the ANC that they want Mcebisi Jonas to be the mayor of Nelson Mandela Bay Metro because he refused money from the Guptas. “We have identified a member of the ANC and citizen, we want such a clean person like Mcebisi Jonas to be a mayor of Nelson Mandela Bay. If there is no Mcebisi or something like him we will fold our arms,” he said. eNCA
