WITBANK, Mpumalanga - Details have emerged of how and why a Mpumalanga teenager with albinism was murdered. The 13-year-old girl and her 15-month-old cousin were kidnapped from their Vosman home in January. The suspects appeared in the Witbank Magistrate's Court on murder and kidnapping charges. The teenager, who was living with albinism, was targeted for her body parts. READ: Three in court for albinism murder Two suspects appeared in court on Tuesday but only one of them was seeking to be released on bail. Thokozani Msibi is said to be the mastermind behind the kidnapping and murder of the two children. One of Msibi's accomplices, who's since turned state witness, confessed that he, Msibi, and the other suspect, were behind the killings. According to the witness, Msibi was going to use the 13-year-old's private parts as payment to a Sangoma in Swaziland. In his affidavit, however, Msibi's denied all nine charges levelled against him, saying as a Sangoma his calling is to heal people, not to harm them. The court denied the Swaziland-born South African bail, saying it cannot ignore the cries of the community and those living with albinism. According to chief Ntsizwe Mahlangu, a traditional leader in the area, the law must run its course. "We feel embarrassed that one person who is said to be performing traditional healing is actually taking people’s bodies and chopping them up in order to strengthen himself in his practice," said Mahlangu. The suspect is due back in court on 13 March. eNCA
