JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa says people should register to vote this weekend as the next general elections are going to be very important. Ramaphosa was speaking on a walkabout in Soweto on Saturday morning where he encouraged residents to register to vote. Eligible voters have been encouraged to visit their voting stations over the weekend as part of a national campaign to update the voters’ roll in preparation for the 2019 polls. READ: Parties bring out the big guns for voter registration drive All voting stations around the country would open to the public between 8am and 5pm on Saturday and Sunday, to assist new voters to register; allow already registered voters who have moved since they registered to re-register in their correct voting district; and allow registered voters whose address details were not on the voters’ roll to provide this information. Ramaphosa described his morning walk in Soweto as special walk intended to mobilise people to register to vote. “We are going door-to-door, asking our people to vote because the next elections are going to very important,” Ramaphosa told Soweto residents. “Right now, it doesn’t matter which party you belong to as long as you register to vote.” “We all have to go out and register this weekend as the next general election is going to be very important for us” #RegisterToVoteANC #OpenRegistrationWeekend pic.twitter.com/64EouCMWVG eNCA
