JOHANNESBURG - Retired deputy chief justice Dikgang Moseneke released the Life Esidimeni Arbitration report on Monday. Last month, the state, Solidarity and Section27 agreed that the families of the mentally ill patients who died should be compensated. The proposed compensation was R200,000, which would cover funeral costs and claims for emotional shock. Section27 also wanted R1.5-million for constitutional damages. On Monday, Moseneke ruled each claimant should be paid R20,000 to each claimant funeral expenses. Government was also ordered to pay R180,000 to each claimant for general damages for shock and psychological trauma, as well as R1 million to each claimant as appropriate relief The total compensation per claimant ordered is, therefore, R1.2 million.
