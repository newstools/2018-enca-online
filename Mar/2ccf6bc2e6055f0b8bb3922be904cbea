JOHANNESBURG - The ANC's new head of organising and campaigns, Senzo Mchunu, said he is concerned about perceptions that the party's leadership is soft on corruption. Mchunu said this could be a key obstacle hindering the party in the 2019 elections.

Also there’s unemployment. People feel we’re not doing enough to lift the burden. These are some issues we’re confronting and have to deal with.” For more on Mchunu's thoughts, view the video in the gallery above. eNCA
