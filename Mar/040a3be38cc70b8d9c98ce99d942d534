JOHANNESBURG - National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) Shaun Abrahams and acting Hawks head Yolisa Matakata will have to explain the delays in arresting suspects in the Gupta-linked Estina Dairy Farm case to Parliament. The two will face a special joint meeting of the Justice and Police Portfolio committees on March 7. On Wednesday, Matakata told Parliament's Police Portfolio Committee, the National Prosecuting Authority delayed approving the arrests of suspects in the Estina Dairy Farm case.

The NPA only arrested the suspects in February. Justice Portfolio Committee chairperson Mathole Matshekga said it is important to get the full picture.

The NPA will have to explain why there was such a long delay,” Matshekga said. “The efforts of the Hawks to fight organised crime should not be hampered by slow decision-making," said Police Portfolio Committee chair, Francois Beukman. "Prosecution-driven cases dealing with state capture and court-ready dockets should be prioritised. We are looking forward working with Dr Motshekga and the justice committee so that progress is made in this very important matter.” eNCA
