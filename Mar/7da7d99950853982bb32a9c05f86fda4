CAPE TOWN - South Africa fast bowler Kagiso Rabada will have his appeal against his two-match ban heard by the ICC on Monday. Rabada was suspended for the remaining two matches of the ongoing four-Test series after being handed three demerit points and a 50 percent fine by ICC match referee Jeff Crowe, for an inappropriate and deliberate shoulder contact with Australia captain Steve Smith on the opening day of the second Test in Port Elizabeth.
