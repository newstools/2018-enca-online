SAN FRANCISCO – Snapchat owner Snap Inc will cut just over 120 engineers and reorganise its engineering team, a company memo said on Thursday. The maker of the Smartphone app known for popularising disappearing messages has been under pressure from investors to reduce costs after revenue fell short of analyst expectations during Snap’s first year as a publicly traded company. According to the memo from Jerry Hunter, senior vice president for engineering, the Southern California Company will offer a package of benefits to those being laid off.
