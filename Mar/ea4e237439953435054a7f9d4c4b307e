PORT ELIZABETH - An unbeaten knock of 74 by AB de Villiers helped South Africa move into a 20-run lead as the hosts reached 263/7 at stumps on day two of the second Test against Australia in Port Elizabeth on Saturday. South Africa had struggled to take the initiative in spite of a good effort by the night watchman Kagiso Rabada (29) who helped Dean Elgar add 45 for the second wicket, and then the third wicket stand of 88 between Elgar and Hashim Amla (56). READ:Â Twitter on fire over St George's brass band Both Elgar (57 off 197 balls, six fours) and Amla (56 off 148 balls, six fours) reached half-centuries, but the Proteas were only able to score 43 runs off the 26 overs that made up the middle session. De Villiers, though, changed the tempo of the match as South Africa scored 110 runs in the final session and, although they lost five wickets in the process they moved ahead of the Australian total of 243 in the first innings. De Villiers reached the close on 74 (81 balls, 14 fours) and still had Vernon Philander (14 not out) for company. The Australian seamers made effective use of reverse swing for most of the second and third sessions to pose some difficult questions for the batsmen, before Steve Smith took the second new ball just over five overs from the close. There was also substantial assistance for spinner Nathan Lyon (1/29) who dismissed Quinton de Kock (nine) with a delivery that both turned and bounced substantially. Pat Cummins (2/55) was the pick of the Australian attack while Mitchell Marsh (2/26) filled a vital role as fourth seamer. African News Agency
