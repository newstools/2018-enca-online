LIMPOPO - Limpopo's finance MEC, Rob Tooley, has accused EFF leader Julius Malema, and former Finance MEC David Masondo of being among those who bankrupted the province. Tooley said that the budget for public works had been bankrupted, with contracts given out without due process taking place. While he was not witness to the corruption, Tooley said he has had to  deal with its consequences, with the province being put under administration. Although the province was under administration, Tooley said it was now financially stable.
