JOHANNESBURG - The Presidency has welcomed findings by Statistics South Africa that gross domestic product growth in Quarter 4 of 2017 reached 3.1 percent. READ: SA's economy grows 1,3% in 2017 In a statement, the Presidency said while GDP growth remains subject to a broad range of market factors and can fluctuate based on such factors, the Quarter 4 improvement should motivate all South Africans. “The Quarter 4 figure does suggest the economy is taking a turn for the better thanks to the efforts of all stakeholders in our economy.” “It is also a very appropriate accompaniment to the positive sentiment with which South Africans and the global community are embracing South Africa’s current renewal,” the Presidency said. “The Presidency hopes that growth of the kind experienced in Quarter 4 will be sustained and that it will translate into meaningful job creation.” eNCA
