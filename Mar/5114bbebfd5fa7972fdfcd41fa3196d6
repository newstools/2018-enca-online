JOHANNESBURG - Western Cape Premier Helen Zille has once again stirred up controversy on Twitter. This time she asked what the families of the victims of the Edisimeni tragedy did to raise the alarm about the plight of their loved ones. Retired deputy chief justice Dikgang Moseneke on Monday announced the outcomes of the Esidimeni arbitration hearings, which set out in horrific detail how mentally ill patients were treated inhumanely and starved to death without the knowledge of their families.

Twitter users slammed Zille for her statement, though she defended it. Zille is by no means new to causing controversy on Twitter.
