SYDNEY - A US rookie on Thursday scored a perfect 10 with a triple barrel, one of the holy grails of the surfing world, likened to a hole-in-one in golf for rarity. The remarkable feat -- a mixture of luck when the perfect wave arrives but also the skill needed to ride its duration -- came during the World Surf League's Quicksilver Pro Gold Coast competition at Kirra Point, Queensland, Australia.

But the top of the wave suddenly crested into a third tube which he successfully rode to whoops from spectators. "Absolutely perfect, tens across the board by every judge," a commentator cheered on a video posted on the World Surf League's Twitter account. A barrel occurs when a breaking wave forms a long tube, allowing a surfer to ride within. "That was really crazy, I wasn't expecting that," a beaming Colapinto said in an interview with organisers. "I just wanted to go out and get any kind of barrel." Describing the triple as "one of the best days of my life" he added, "I've never gotten three barrels on one wave like that. In a contest too. Insane." AFP
