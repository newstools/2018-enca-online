JOHANNESBURG - A Los Angeles street artist called Plastic Jesus has created a life-size golden statue of the infamous film producer Harvey Weinstein on Hollywood Boulevard. The movie mogul is depicted in a silk robe, sitting on a couch and holding an Oscar award in a suggestive way on his lap. The work is titled "Casting Couch". On his Facebook page, Plastic Jesus said it took two months to complete the statue, with a little help from a friend who had a similar build to Weinstein. The aim of the installation was to place the spotlight on the crisis of sexual abuse in the Hollywood entertainment industry and on the disgraced film producer. According to reports, Weinstein will not be attending this year's Oscars due to the sexual misconduct allegations levelled against him by more than 70 women. No wonder... he hasn't been convicted of anything.
		Trial by Hollywood.
		Meh! What is he holding?
		Ugh.... Never mess with artists. the sculpture flatters his looks, does it not? Harvey has enough Oscars that they could have been melted down to make this statue. this seems like it would do more harm to victims of his actions than to him -- what goes up, must come down. so enjoyable! pic.twitter.com/9CVk4YX785 eNCA
