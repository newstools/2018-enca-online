JOHANNESBURG - The South African Revenue Services (SARS) is ready to implement the increase in Value-Added Tax (VAT) from 14 percent to 15 percent on April 1, as announced by the Minister of Finance during the February budget speech. "SARS teams have been working on changes to the systems which are used to receive VAT declarations made by vendors and calculate any VAT refunds or VAT due to SARS. Changes to the VAT201 form have been made to reflect the increase in the VAT rate," SARS said in a statement on Tuesday.

Vendors must request a new VAT201 on eFiling." SARS also urged vendors to update their systems to align to the new VAT rate in preparation for April 1, in order to minimise confusion for the customer and make it easier for vendors to remain tax compliant and make the correct declarations to Sars. WATCH: Kingon determined to get SARS back on track "Vendors are encouraged to visit the Value Added Tax page on the SARS website www.sars.gov.za where they will find a Pocket Guide and a set of Frequently Asked Questions to assist them in understanding the implications of the VAT rate increase on various types of transactions."
