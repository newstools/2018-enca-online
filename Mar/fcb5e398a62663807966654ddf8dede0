LUANDA - Angola experienced its first authorised anti-government protest in decades with about 10 people demonstrating in the capital on Saturday against an amnesty for those who have stashed vast wealth abroad. Despite the paltry turnout, the rally in the centre of Luanda was a milestone and hugely symbolic.

Some of the demonstrators held up portraits of Dos Santos's successor, Joao Lourenco, disfigured with red paint. They denounced a law adopted at the end of February granting amnesty to anyone repatriating more than $100,000 (R1.1-million) from overseas accounts in the coming six months. These people will also not face questioning about the source of the funds. Lourenco has told Angolans to repatriate funds illegally held abroad in the coming months or risk prosecution, in a bid to spur domestic investment and combat corruption.

The amnesty will benefit "those who have illegally acquired riches", said protestor Fernando Macedo, a university professor. After nearly 30 years of civil war came to an end in 2002, Angola’s economy grew at a rapid pace thanks to an oil boom. But sweeping corruption, cronyism and mismanagement have seen a huge chasm between the handful of haves and the overwhelming majority living in dire poverty. AFP
