JOHANNESBURG - The Reserve Bank is widely expected to cut the repo rate by 25 basis points after its monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting on Wednesday. The committee will have to grapple with a low consumer price inflation (CPI) number pitted against increases in taxes such as VAT and the fuel levy. The increases, which come into effect on Saturday, are expected to have an impact on inflation in the coming months. Boosted by a drop in food and non-alcoholic beverages and a cut in the petrol price, the CPI eased to four percent in February from 4.4 percent in January. Economists expect VAT to add at least 0.5 percent to that number, while fuel inflation is expected to remain flat.

On the whole, we’re not seeing a huge impact on the fuel levy,” said Econometrix economist, Azar Jammine. With economic growth on a positive growth trajectory, the main concern for the bank will be inflation expectations. According to the Bureau for Economic Research in Stellenbosch, average inflation expectations for 2018 remain close to the upper end of the target range of six percent, but this may change.

With the uncertainty of the Moodys rating behind the country, Jammine said there is a case for a 25 basis points cut to the repo rate. He believes the central bank could find itself under extreme pressure if interest rates are not cut. eNCA
