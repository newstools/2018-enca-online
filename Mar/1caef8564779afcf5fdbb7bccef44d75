JOHANNESBURG - Home Affairs Director-General, Mkuseli Apleni is denying reports that his officials arrested Indian employees at ANN7 TV. This despite Home Affairs spokesperson Mayihlome Tshwete confirming that "four people who don't have the necessary documentation" were detained following a raid at the suspended broadcaster's office in Midrand. READ: Home Affairs raids ANN7 offices, four detained Apleni said it was not the first visit to the office. "We went to ANN7 in 2016. Again we went back yesterday [Tuesday]. It was a follow-up. You will recall at that time we did indicate that when our officials were there was nobody in the HR department to give us certain information to verify. So after that date we proceeded with the verification of information," said Apleni. "What happened yesterday while we were waiting for the information [was that] people had to leave. We said, 'No, remain until we get what we are able to get.' Once we were done we released them. So they were not arrested, but it was a question of saying we are still wanting to verify this so that when we release you have got some information," he said. Apleni said the team would meet with the members of ANN7 again on Thursday "to close that process". eNCA
