JOHANNESBURG – Abiy Ahmed has been voted in as Ethiopia's new prime minister following the resignation of Hailemariam Desalegn last month. Desalegn resigned as pressure mounted following ethnic tensions in the country and mass protests. This led to the declaration of a state of emergency, exactly a day after Desalegn's resignation. The coalition decided emergency rule was "vital to safeguarding the constitutional order," state-run Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation said.
