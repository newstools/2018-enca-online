JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Opera is in deep financial trouble. It may have to close its doors if funding isn't found to keep it afloat. Singers affiliated to the institution could see their careers come to a halt.

	The organisation's CEO says support isn't just about money.
	
	Arnold Cloete, Gauteng Opera CEO said: “We also need the public to support performances, because that way people can give and not feel that they have to give R20,000, but just by a ticket of R100 and attend performances that will get Gauteng opera to survive.”
