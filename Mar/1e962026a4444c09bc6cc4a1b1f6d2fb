Power supply to her property was disconnected on 16 January 2018 by the city’s technicians. Yesterday [Friday], when the operation #BuyaMthetho team returned to the property, they found that the electricity to the property was illegally reconnected," he said. "I have instructed the JMPD to monitor properties that have been visited as part of the operation and ensure that services are not illegally reconnected at these sites. If they are reconnected the owners will be arrested immediately. "I have every faith that the JMPD, working with our law enforcement partners, will do all it can to ensure lawbreakers are held to account. This operation is conducted on a daily basis as a ward-based 'raid' initiative," the mayor said Operation #BuyaMthetho's main focus was to ensure city by-laws were adhered to and that the rule of law became the order of the day. The city, working with all state enforcement agencies, would not leave any stone unturned when dealing with criminal activities, said Mashaba. "I would also like to encourage people to report any theft, fraud, and corruption activities through our 24-hour tip-off hotline 0800-002-587 or visit the city’s forensic and investigation services at 48 Ameshoff Street in Braamfontein," he said.
