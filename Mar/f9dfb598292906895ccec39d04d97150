JOHANNESBURG - AfriForum has opposed any restriction on the display of the old South African flag as an infringement on free speech. The lobby group's deputy CEO, Ernst Roets, says: "The notion that you can fight ideas by banning a symbol has never worked. You should engage and debate with those people and prove to them why they are wrong. Banning it would not solve anything" The Nelson Mandela Foundation has applied to the Equality Court in Johannesburg for an order declaring the gratuitous display of the old flag as hate speech, unfair discrimination and race-based harassment. The foundation says the move follows years of observing public displays of the old flag and by attitudes displayed by some during debates with AfriForum that apartheid was not a crime against humanity.
