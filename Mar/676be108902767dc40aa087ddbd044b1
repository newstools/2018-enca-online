JOHANNESBURG - Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe says the ANC top six do not have the power to fire any members of the organisation accused of corruption. Mantashe was being interviewed by eNCA reporter Samkele Maseko following a visit to the embattled Optimum coal mine on Thursday. WATCH: Ndlozi, Shivambu kicked out of Parliament Maseko asked Mantashe about Minister of Home Affairs Malusi Gigaba, who is accused of lying to Parliament about the naturalisation of the Gupta brothers. Mantashe said the top six could not fire someone they did not hire. Ministers were appointed by the president. 
	
	"The [ANC] resolution talks about stepping aside, it does not talk about the top six firing them. When you talk about stepping aside, you must appeal to your own conscience and say, 'My standing brings the ANC into disrepute and I’m stepping aside for the sake of the ANC.' It appeals to the conscience of the individual," he said. Alternatively, the party's integrity commission has the authority to ask members to step aside. Mantashe said there would be chaos if everybody could call others to step aside. eNCA
