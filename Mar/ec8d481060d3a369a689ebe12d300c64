JOHANNESBURG – The South African Rugby Players Association (SARPA) on Thursday lodged an application in the High Court in East London for the liquidation of the Border Rugby Union. SARPA represents the professional rugby players employed by the union. It said the Border Rugby Union failed to pay players full salaries since December 2017. As a result, SARPA said members were without medical aid. SARPA said it wrote its list of demands to the Union, which failed to meet commitments made to players, attributing failures to cash-flow challenges. The association’s Managing Director Eugene Henning said liquidation was the only viable solution, although no party would gain with such a move.

In August 2016, SARPA applied for the liquidation of Eastern Province Rugby Pty Ltd, again due to non-payment of salaries to players. eNCA
