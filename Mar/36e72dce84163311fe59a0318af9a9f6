BERLIN - A Mario Gomez brace and an embarrassing mistake from goalkeeper Timo Horn saw Stuttgart come from behind to beat Cologne 3-2 on Sunday. Having scored early on, Cologne failed to hold a lead which would have lifted them off the bottom of the Bundesliga table for the first time since August. What a horrible mistake by Timo Horn this evening!#BUNDESLIGAxESPN pic.twitter.com/yw4Q3dOuIM Claudio Pizarro put Cologne ahead after just six minutes. Having won the ball in the final third, Yuya Osako set up the veteran striker, who swept the ball into the far corner. Former Stuttgart striker Simon Terrodde could have doubled the lead on the half-hour mark but dragged his shot wide of the near post. Osako then found the net six minutes later, but a foul on goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler in the build-up saw the goal ruled out by VAR. Timo Horn gets a boost from the home terrace, his name rings out. It was his mistake that changed the game on the stroke of half time. The crowd can see the utter pain in him as he leaves the pitch .. #KOEVFB pic.twitter.com/jue3siUgE7 Cologne, though, would go into half-time a goal down after two strikes in quick succession from Gomez. The veteran striker fired in an equaliser in the 45th minute and was gifted a second moments later when Horn allowed a low shot to slip out of his hands and bounce over him into the net. Things got worse for Cologne on 57 minutes, when Andreas Beck squeezed a low shot past Horn to give Stuttgart a third. Milos Jojic pulled a goal back with a fine free-kick three minutes from time, but it was too little, too late for Cologne. AFP
