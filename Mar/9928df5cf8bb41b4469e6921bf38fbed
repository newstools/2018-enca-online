SOWETO - President Cyril Ramphosa says former police minister Fikile Mbalula will secure a landslide victory for the African National Congress (ANC) in next year’s general elections. The former police minister resigned as a Member of Parliament on Friday. Mbalula, who also previously served as sports minister, was now focussing on his new role as the governing party's head of elections. “Comrade Mbaks [Mbalula] is the head of elections. When we took him out of Parliament and when we said get out of the Cabinet and run elections, some people thought we were mad. "But we are absolutely right because he is the person who is going to win us our election,” Ramaphosa said.
