SAN FRANCISCO - Facebook Inc is giving users more control over their privacy by making data management easier and redesigning the settings menu, the company said on Wednesday. The move comes in the wake of a scandal over a breach that exposed the personal information of millions and was allegedly used by a political consultancy. Facebook also said it would propose in the coming weeks updates to the social media website’s terms of service and data policy to better spell out what information it collects and how it uses it.

Facebook shares are down nearly 18 percent since 16 March, when it first acknowledged that user data had been improperly channelled to Cambridge Analytica, eating away nearly $100 billion of the company’s market value.

In addition to redesigning its settings menu on mobile devices, Facebook said it is creating a new privacy shortcut menu where users would be able to better secure their accounts and control personal information.
