INDIAN WELLS - Kevin Anderson's recent impressive run came to an abrupt end on Thursday (Friday morning SA time) when he was knocked out of the Indian Wells Masters quarterfinals by unseeded Borna Coric of Croatia. He beat South Africa's world No 9 and the tournament's seventh seed 2-6 6-4 7-6(3) in a match that lasted 2hrs 22min. The 21-year-old Croatian had initially looked out-gunned by the big-serving Anderson, who had won all three of their previous meetings without dropping a set but he started improving his groundstrokes, getting Anderson involved in long rallies. “I didn’t start very well. He was hitting the ball very big, and I just couldn’t find my rhythm on the ball,” Coric said. “I started going more for the serve. And then I broke him earlier in the second set, which was really helpful.

Anderson was erratic in the tie-breaker, making too many errors to lose 7-3. “I knew that I lost to him three times in a row, you know, and in the past, I never played good against him, so obviously it was not easy,” Coric said. “I was just saying to myself, just, I need, you know, one or two good points and he makes one double fault, and that’s what happened in the second set. That’s exactly what happened. I played, I think, two good points. He made a double fault at some point, and, you know, that’s it. “And I needed to start to serve much better. That’s what I did. I was going more for the serves, I was taking more risk, and that’s what happened in the third set.” Coric will face world No.1 Roger Federer for a spot in the Indian Wells final. African News Agency
