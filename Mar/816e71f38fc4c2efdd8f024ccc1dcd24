JOHANNESBURG - Rainbow Chicken's polony has been declared clear of a deadly strain of Listeria. The food-borne disease has killed at least 183 people in South Africa since the beginning of last year. This is the world’s biggest ever outbreak of listeriosis. Department of Health officials earlier this year confirmed traces of listeria bacteria found at Rainbow Chicken's Sasolburg plant. At the time, authorities said it was not the same as the deadly ST-6 strain.
