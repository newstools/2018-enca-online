JOHANNESBURG - The National Council of SPCAs (NSPCA) was refused entry into former president Jacob Zuma's Nkandla home after receiving complaints of animal neglect at the former president's home, the organisation said on Thursday. The animal protection body said its inspector had to get a court order to gain entry and probe animal neglect allegations at Nkandla. The NSPCA said it received complaints that there were only security personnel at Zuma's home and that no one was taking charge and caring for the animals.

He then approached the court and was granted a warrant to enter the property and inspect the animals but was still denied entry due to it being a National Key Point. "The Inspector approached the relevant officials and was finally granted entry to inspect the conditions under which the animals were being kept and no animals had been abandoned," the animal welfare body said.
