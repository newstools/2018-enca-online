The talk was followed by a question and answer session. According to Mbembe, black people are as capable of racism as any other race. "Can black people be racist? Yes, of course, I mean, they can at least perform racist acts. They are absolutely capable of that. They can act racist, whatever definition we want to use here," says Mbembe.
