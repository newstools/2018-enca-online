CAPE TOWN – Minister Malusi Gigaba provided feedback on the meeting he attended with the Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs in Parliament about the naturalisation of members of the Gupta family on Tuesday afternoon. The minister called a press briefing on the matter. He said, among other things, that should the Guptas be found guilty of a criminal offense in future in South Africa, their citizenship or, where applicable, permanent residency, would be revoked. READ: Home Affairs again defends Gigaba over Guptas' citizenship To date, the Department of Home Affairs has defended Gigaba for fast-tracking the family’s citizenship application. Gigaba returned to the department recently after he was moved from the finance portfolio during the recent Cabinet reshuffle. The minister came under fire in 2017, when it emerged he personally intervened to help the Guptas with their naturalisation certificates in 2015. eNCA
