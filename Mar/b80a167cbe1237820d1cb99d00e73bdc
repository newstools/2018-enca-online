MANCHESTER, United Kingdom - Jose Mourinho slammed criticism of Manchester United's cautious approach in their 2-1 win over bitter rivals Liverpool on Saturday. Mourinho's second-placed side moved five points clear of Liverpool in the Premier League thanks to Marcus Rashford's first-half double at Old Trafford. Liverpool dominated possession as United sat back for long periods and Eric Bailly's second-half own goal set up a tense finish. But United stuck to Mourinho's conservative game-plan to clinch the points and the Portuguese coach was in typically defiant mood when asked about the defensive tactics.

I don't care what people say. The boys are happy, I'm happy." Mourinho insisted United had been rewarded for taking their chances in the first half and he was happy with the way his players soaked up the pressure after the interval. AFP
