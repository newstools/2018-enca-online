JOHANNESBURG – The South African Civil Aviation Authority has seen revenue go up by 11,47 percent in the past financial year. Revenue soared to R608 million from R539 million the previous year. Presenting its financials on Monday, the authority – which is rated number one on the continent – said the accident rate in the industry dropped 50 percent over the last four years but increased in the past year. South Africa’s aviation industry has a strong record with no fatalities reported since the advent of democracy.

But the authority is concerned that that figure has now increased to 75. “We have seen that there is a bit of a spike in the accident rate … The accident rate has increased when compared to the previous financial year,” the Civil Aviation Authority's Poppy Khoza said. “We believe that we need to pay more attention to ensure that we curb and drastically reduce the accident rate in the general aviation area.” READ: 2017 safest year for post-war civil aviation: industry agencies But like many sectors of the South African economy, the industry is faced with a lack of transformation. Khoza said transformation remained a key issue. “It is our belief that it cannot be correct that statistics still indicate that about 8 percent of the population in the industry is black while 92 percent are white, so the playing fields are not normal. We need to do more in order to transform this industry.” The authority, which falls under the Department of Transport, is one of few entities that has a good handle on its finances. eNCA
