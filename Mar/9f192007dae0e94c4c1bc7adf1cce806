JOHANNESBURG - The Mauritian parliament will on Friday discuss the future of President Ameenah Gurib-Fakim, Africa’s only female head of state, who faces being unseated in the wake of a financial scandal. Gurib-Fakim, a former chemistry professor and science faculty dean at the University of Mauritius, faces allegations of purchasing clothing and jewellery with a credit card provided by non-governmental group Planet Earth. Planet Earth's Angolan founder has sought to do business in Mauritius and is under investigation for alleged corruption in Portugal.

According to the Mauritius constitution, a president can be removed through parliamentary votes against him or her and an investigation by a tribunal that allows the president to offer a defence.
