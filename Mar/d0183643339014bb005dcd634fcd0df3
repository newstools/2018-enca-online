MIAMI - Maria Sharapova has withdrawn from next week's Miami Open after suffering an injury to her left forearm, organisers announced on Friday. The five-time Grand Slam champion has been replaced in the main draw for the Florida showpiece by American Jennifer Brady, a statement said. "I am really sorry that I have to withdraw from one of my favourite tournaments with my left forearm injury," said Sharapova. "I am doing everything possible to return to the tour as soon as possible." Unfortunately, a forearm injury is forcing @MariaSharapova to withdraw from Miami.
		
		Best wishes on a quick recovery, Maria. We look forward to seeing you back here in 2019.

That defeat prompted a split with coach Sven Groeneveld, who was axed on Thursday after four years of working with the Russian star. Sharapova, 30, is continuing to search for consistent performances as she works her way back from a 15-month drugs ban. Her loss on Wednesday came after she withdrew from the Dubai tournament last month, also because of her forearm injury.

"We were looking forward to seeing her play Wednesday, but unfortunately injuries are part of the game. We hope she recovers quickly and is back on the court soon." AFP
