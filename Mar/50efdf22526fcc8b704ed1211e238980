And now Rio 2016 Olympic Super Heavyweight gold medalist, Tony Yoka joins the every growing list with a one year ban for missed drug tests pic.twitter.com/i1nLAG90xk The 25-year-old, who turned professional after winning gold in Rio two years ago, was penalised after missing the unannounced tests between July 2016 and July 2017. His lawyer Arnaud Pericard said the first missed test came while Yoka was on a plane back from training in the United States, with the second "during a period of relaxation", when he "didn't know he was still subject to geolocation requirements". The last two missed tests also came when controllers went to Yoka's house in France while he was in the US, according to Pericard. Yoka faces former French heavyweight champion Cyril Leonet in his next fight in Paris on April 7, having won his first three professional bouts. AFP
