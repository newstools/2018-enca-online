WASHINGTON - Wall Street turned negative around midday Friday amid fears China could slow its purchases of US debt as trade tensions between Washington and Beijing reach fever pitch. The possibility China could halt or scale back its purchases of Treasury bonds has long been a fear on financial markets, and Beijing's ambassador Washington would not rule out the move as part of the retaliation against the punitive trade measures announced by President Donald Trump. "We are looking at all options," Ambassador Cui TiankaiÂ told Bloomberg Television when asked if the government would target purchases of Treasuries. China is America's largest creditor, holding $1.2 trillion or about 20 percent of all foreign-held US debt as of January. But economists note that China has its own domestic reasons for investing in US currency, including keeping its massive reserves from flooding into the economy and fueling inflation. Trump on Thursday authorized new tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese goods imports to retaliate for the country's years of mass "theft" of US intellectual property. China immediate responded by saying it would target a list of US goods, and saying it was not afraid of a trade war. But it omitted aircraft and soybeans and also said it will try to negotiate a solution to the dispute. The US is on course to increase its borrowing after enacting $1.5 trillion in spending cuts in December and boosting spending in February, which economists say will balloon budget deficits. With markets already sharply lower amid fears of a trade war, the benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average sank following the report and was down 0.3 percent shortly before 1700 GMT after paring some losses. The broader S&P 500 had fallen a similar amount while the tech-heavy Nasdaq gave up 0.9 percent.
