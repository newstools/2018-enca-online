	Busisiwe Mkhwebane appeareD before Parliament on Tuesday over her recent public utterances linked to the Absa CIEX report and the Estina Dairy Farm issue. In the CIEX matter, the North Gauteng High court found that she didnâ€™t understand her constitutional duty. With the Estina report, Mkhwebane said the Free State Agriculture Department did not improperly enter into a public/private partnership with the Estina dairy farm. According to the report, it was found that officials flouted procedural rules. Mkhwebane has told her department she refused to resign until her term ends in 2023. !function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+"://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,"script","twitter-wjs"); eNCA
