JOHANNESBURG - The JSE closed weaker on Friday‚ as the possibility of a global trade war weighed on equity markets. The Dow Jones was 1.3 percent lower at the JSE’s close‚ with European markets also weaker. The FTSE was down 1.29 percent after UK prime minister Theresa May admitted that Brexit would reduce access to EU markets. Concern about local political developments dampened sentiment‚ as the all share ended its second week of losses following almost euphoric trade in mid-February when President Cyril Ramaphosa took office. A sharply weaker rand‚ hitting R12 to the dollar in intra-day trade‚ failed to provide any support to global diversified miners. Naspers was lower on retreating Asian markets‚ with Tencent falling two percent on the Hang Seng. The threat of the expropriation of land without compensation also kept the local bourse under pressure. Gold and property shares were the star performers on the day‚ with retailers providing some support. Risk-off sentiment affected banks and financials‚ despite the market warming to Nedbank’s upbeat annual results‚ as it looked past rising losses from its African activities. Protectionist measures announced by US President Donald Trump’s administration spooked global markets. Trump said the US would impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports‚ which might spark some retaliation from China and have the potential to start a global trade war. It came at a time when markets are still digesting less hawkish comments from US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell on Thursday.
