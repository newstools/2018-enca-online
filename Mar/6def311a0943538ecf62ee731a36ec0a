JOHANNESBURG - The South African Revenue Service (SARS) rogue unit saga has returned. Former senior staff members Ivan Pillay, Johann van Loggerenberg, and Andries Janse van Rensburg have been charged anew for their alleged involvement. Set up in 2007, the unit's mandate was to investigate organised crime and illicit trading. WATCH: What exactly is the so-called Sars rogue unit? The four former employees were served with summonses Friday morning to appear in court on the 9th of April. The charges relate to “Project Sunday Evenings”, a secretive intelligence exercise run by SARS. It was set up, allegedly to spy on the National Prosecuting Authority, which was gunning for then-National Police Commissioner Jackie Selebi. Journalist Pauli van Wyk joined eNCA anchor, Michelle Craig, earlier.
