JOHANNESBURG - Caster Semenya will be South Africa's flagbearer at the Commonwealth Games at the Gold Coast, Australia, it was announced at Monday's farewell dinner for the athletes in Johannesburg. Sascoc president Gideon Sam said double Olympic 800m gold medallist Semenya will have the honour of leading the team onto the track. "There are many luminaries in this team but the board of Sascoc have decided that Caster will fly the flag for SA." For her part, Semenya was brief but buoyant.

Semenya was referring to Sam’s look ahead to possible medals coming South Africa’s way as he urged the team to improve on their seventh-place showing on the medals table at the last Games in Glasgow, Scotland four years ago. Semenya is entered in the 800 and 1500m track events. "We fell from fifth in New Delhi, India in 2010 to seventh at Glasgow and we have to make a top-five place our goal this time out," said Sam. In Glasgow, South Africa won 40 medals.
