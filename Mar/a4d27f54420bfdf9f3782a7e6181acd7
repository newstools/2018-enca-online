SYDNEY - A message in a bottle, written 132 years ago and found on an Australian beach by a group of walkers, has been verified as the world's oldest known missive of its kind. The rectangular bottle was discovered half-buried in sand dunes near Wedge Island, some 160 kilometres north of Perth, in January. It took weeks of sleuthing using Google Translate, online research and archival digging, before the unusual find was confirmed as an authentic bottle thrown from a German ship into the Indian Ocean. The previous oldest known message in a bottle was found in Germany 108 years and 138 days after it was thrown into the North Sea by a marine biologist in 1906. For more, watch the video below.
