But this is the service that we do not need. The health service in South Africa does not need this service at all," said Motsoaledi. "In fact I don't think I will be wrong to characterised it as an ATM card through which the Guptas are withdrawing money from the department of health. Unfortunately I can’t describe it in any other way. This service hear is an ATM card there is no other way," he said. About 140 employees who work for Gupta-linked mobile clinic company Mediosa have not been paid their February salaries. eNCA
