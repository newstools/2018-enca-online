JOHANNESBURG – Judgment has been reserved in the Sassa matter. Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng has lambasted Sassa for requesting a six-month extension on its contract with Cash Paymaster Services. READ: Dlamini in the hot seat at Sassa inquiry The contract was declared invalid in 2014. Sassa says it can't meet the court's deadline of the first of April to appoint a new service provider. “The court is still being approached after so many years of saying this is unlawful. An unlawfulness continues to be perpetuated while we are watching it is very sad...It is like we are being laughed at by Sassa and CPS. It's most unfortunate and what is even sadder, there is no explanation. You know when someone does something wrong. No explanation that we can understand has been put before us,” said Mogoeng.
