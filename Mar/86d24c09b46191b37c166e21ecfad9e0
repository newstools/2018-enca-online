"Our members are loyal and disciplined liberation fighters. We have and protected gains made by the ANC. There must be no doubt that similarly to how we supported president Zuma as president we will do the same for the newly-elected ANC NEC under the leadership of comrade President Cyril Ramaphosa,” said MKMVA leader Kebby Maphatsoe. Maphatsoe says they have pledged their support to President Ramaphosa, we discussed the unauthorised statements where our members criticised Ramaphosa and distance themselves from that. #MKVA Maphatsoe is essentially praising former President Zuma for resigning and saying he attended the party's engagement, it deserves special mention. #MKVA Regarding the recent cabinet reshuffle, the MKMVA said it was unhappy the Des van Rooyen, one of its top members, was removed as a minister. Maphatsoe says with regards to the cabinet reshuffle they are unhappy that their Treasurer Des Van Rooyen was removed. #MKVA pic.twitter.com/ioDBuIFNh8 The Association also spoke about the recent police killings in eNgcobo in the Eastern Cape, echoing police minister Bheki Cele's calls that officers should retaliate with fire when they come under attack. #MKVA Maphatsoe says police can't be attacked with guns but they can't shoot people randomly. pic.twitter.com/zz4Eb4g8q7 eNCA
