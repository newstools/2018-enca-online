JOHANNESBURG - An act of forgiveness is not always easy to give. Disgraced former Australian cricket captain Steve Smith will find it tough to earn the trust of cricket fans all over the world â€“ after he was implicated in a ball-tampering scandal, which rocked world cricket recently. His story could be compared to the late Hansie Cronje, who many will remember him for his involvement in match-fixing, rather than being one of the greatest captains the game has ever produced. But, as Ronald Masinda found out, unlike those who remember Cronje for corruption, in Bloemfontein his legacy lives on 16 years after his untimely death. eNCA
