JOHANNESBURG – The outcome of cricketer Kagiso Rabada’s suspension appeal will only be known in the coming days. It seems that cricket has taken a bit of a back seat with all concentration on disciplinary matters. The current series between the Proteas and Australia has become known for the drama off the field, instead of on. Players are hoping that off-field matters will be sorted out soon ahead of Thursday's third Test. “We haven’t even spoken about it since we’ve got together today,” Proteas Batsman Dean Elgar told eNCA. READ: Still plenty of needle with or without Rabada, says Elgar He said as players, they were trying to isolate themselves away from that situation. “We know as players, we don’t have any influence with regards to what has happened in the hearing or what can possibly happen. “It would be nice to put it behind us now. I think there’s been so much noise and people have actually forgotten, like I mentioned earlier, there’s such a great Test series actually happening between two extremely strong and competitive teams. It’s just a pity that all this backroom noise is actually hindering what is actually quite an exciting series,” Elgar added. eNCA
