BRITAIN – Mohamed Salah struck four times in rampant Liverpool's 5-0 thrashing of Watford that lifted them back into third spot in the Premier League on Saturday. The unstoppable Egyptian needed only four minutes to put his side in front and he doubled his tally just before halftime. He set up Roberto Firmino for a cheeky effort early in the second half before placing a shot through a crowd of Watford defenders to complete his first Liverpool hat-trick. There was no respite for Watford at a snowy Anfield as Salah smashed in his fourth goal in the 85th minute.

Defeat left Watford in 11th spot, a comfortable eight points above the relegation zone. Reuters
