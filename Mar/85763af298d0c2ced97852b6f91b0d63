JOHANNESBURG - Ever wanted to be someone famous for a day? A chart-topping rapper maybe? In Chris Brown's latest music video, "Freaky Friday", the musician swaps bodies with a regular guy called Dicky. While Lil Dicky enjoys his new lifestyle, Brown quickly tires of Dicky's boring existence. The idea is based on the 2003 Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis movie of the same name in which a mom and daughter swap bodies.
