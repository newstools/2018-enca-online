JOHANNESBURG - A building housing the Free State Provincial Legislature, Road Accident Fund and Legal Aid is in the dark, following a power cut due to non-payment of bills, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) said on Thursday. Two of the country's four top banks in the same building are also experiencing a blackout. MPLs and other staff are now housed in an adjacent building. In a statement, the EFF in the Free State claims the affected building belongs to a close associate of ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule. The party alleges that embattled businessman Isaac “Blacky” Seoe is also close to Magashule's two children.

"The EFF in the province has reliably learned that more than R500,000 electricity bill for the building has not been paid as the assets of the controversial businessman have been attached by the Asset Forfeiture Unit as possible proceeds of crime. "We deeply lament the fact that crucial work related to issues of governance in the province have been effectively disrupted to a halt for the second day in a row and the people of Free State are the ones that stand to lose much.

The party welcomed law enforcement agencies' recent clampdown on corruption and said it is confident the billions stolen through corruption under Magashule's tenure as premier, can be recovered. eNCA
