They did not say how many girls had come back. A military officer at a checkpoint near Dapchi told Reuters: "Boko Haram has brought the girls." The kidnapping on 19 February of the girls aged 11-19, was the biggest mass abduction since Boko Haram took more than 270 schoolgirls from the town of Chibok in 2014 - a case that triggered international outrage.
