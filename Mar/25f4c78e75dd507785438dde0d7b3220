RUSTENBURG - Despite languishing in bottom spot on the Premiership table, Platinum Stars rising midfielder Charles Baloyi is convinced his side will beat their relegation woes. The 21-year-old is not concerned that the Phokeng-based side are heavy favourites to be relegated as they are seven points behind Ajax Cape Town in 15th place on the 16-team log. With just seven games left in the season, it seems increasingly likely that Stars will not be playing their football in the Premiership next season. “I want to help the team out of the relegation zone. I believe we can still get out of the relegation zone,” said Baloyi. “We just need to continue working hard each and every day. We lack when it comes to scoring. We need to finish our chances. We also have to trust one another. We have to be confident in front of goals. We have to play for the team and not for individuals. That way we will win and come out,” said the midfielder. Baloyi joined Platinum Stars youth structures at the age of 13, in pursuit of a dream of playing at professional level. Now 21, Baloyi is living the dream, but not quite how he had imagined. “I am happy to have gotten a chance to play regularly and realise my dreams. When I wasn’t playing, I felt bad but I was giving 100 percent at training. Each and every day I gave my best and now I got a chance. It shows hard work works,” said Baloyi, who has become a regular in Roger De Sa’s team. The next league assignment for Stars is a trip to Bloemfontein Celtic on Sunday. “We have to go in one spirit to Celtic. We have to work hard and take our chances. They also have faults. We have to score goals and get the maximum points,” said Baloyi. African News Agency
