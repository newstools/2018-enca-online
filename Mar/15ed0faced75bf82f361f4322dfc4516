FREETOWN - Election authorities in Sierra Leone accused police late on Wednesday of intimidating staff and obstructing their work as they prepared for next week's presidential run-off vote. The National Election Commission said officers entered its offices "unannounced and at random". The police declined to comment. Sierra Leonians head to the polls on March 27 for a second round of elections to pick a successor to outgoing President Ernest Bai Koroma. Opposition leader Julius Maada Bio of the Sierra Leone People's Party will be running against Samura Kamara of the ruling All People's Congress, after neither of the two front-runners secured an outright majority in the first round.
