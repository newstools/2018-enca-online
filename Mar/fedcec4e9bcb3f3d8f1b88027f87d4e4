JOHANNESBURG - The issue of the controversial Gupta brothers' citizenship is as clear as mud. On Tuesday afternoon, newly re-appointed Minister of Home Affairs, Malusi Gigaba, held a press briefing where he stated that Ajay and Athul Gupta are not South African citizens. Gigaba:Everything regarding #Gupta citizenship was above board and to the law. I'm happy the matter has been settled.
