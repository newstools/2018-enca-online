CAPE TOWN - Songo Specialized’s Annika Langvad and Kate Courtney led from start-to-finish in the women’s race of the Cape Epic and capped it off in fine style in the final stage at Val de Vie on Sunday. Langvad and Courtney took fourth place on the day to add to their six stage wins and prologue victory for a total time of 29 hours 57 minutes and six seconds. Ascendis Health’s Sabine Spitz and Robyn de Groot finished second overall, with Silverback-KMC’s Mariske Strauss and Annie Last in third. “That was a good day,” said Langvad after the champagne celebrations on the finish line. “Our main goal today was just to get to the finish line. “This is all a little bit unbelievable and a lot more than I could have asked for. Coming here and doing so well with the Epic World Cup win and the Absa Cape Epic is unbelievable. It has been amazing to race with Kate and I have enjoyed it a lot.” Courtney was also surprised at how well the eight days of racing had progressed. “It is definitely a bit of an emotional finish for me. When I set out to do the Absa Cape Epic, my first marathon and stage race, people thought I was a little crazy but my inner circle supported me and helped me get here. “And Specialized gave me the opportunity to race with one of my heroes in the sport and I could not have asked for a better experience. And I think I have proved to myself that I can do it. “It has been an incredible week of teamwork and so I do not think there is much more that we can ask for.” In the men’s race, Songo-Specialized’s Jaroslav Kulhavy and Howard Grotts claimed the overall title in a time of 25:29:48. Canyon Topeark’s Alban Lakata and Kristian Hynek were second overall with Buff Scott MTB’s Francesc Guerra Carretero and Luis Leao Pinto completing the podium. African News Agency
