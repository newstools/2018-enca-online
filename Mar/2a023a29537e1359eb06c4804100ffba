JOHANNESBURG - As motorists brace themselves for a hefty fuel price increase in April, due to a hike in the fuel levy, the month of March will at least, provide some relief at the pumps. Both grades of petrol will drop by 36c/l, diesel by 44c and 47c/l, and illuminating paraffin by 22c/l. WATCH: VAT, fuel levy to increase The main reasons for the decreases are a stronger rand/dollar exchange rate and a decrease in the international price of brent crude oil. From April 1, the fuel levy will rise by 52c/l, as announced in in the budget speech. eNCA
