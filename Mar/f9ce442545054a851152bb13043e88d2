JOHANNESBURG - South Africa is largely expected to escape a credit rating downgrade from Moody’s tomorrow. But analysts warn the country’s economic fundamentals remain in the doldrums despite the huge swing in sentiment at the end of last year. Dismal economic growth, political and policy uncertainty, and a cash-guzzling state-owned-enterprises pushed the country into junk status last year.

Whether the swing in political and economic sentiment since the ANC’s elective conference in December will sufficiently offset South Africa's increased borrowing costs remains to be seen. Novare economic strategist Tumisho Grater believes so. He said, “I think it’s already been priced into the markets that we may avoid a credit rating downgrade. They will also look at the growth trajectory. Those GDP numbers were better than expected. State-owned enterprises… we are seeing new leadership coming in… New people at the helm” The move to suspend SARS Commissioner Tom Moyane is also expected to help the country avoid a downgrade, as shortfalls of revenue under his tenure have been unprecedented since the 2008 financial crisis.
	
	If Moody’s does downgrade South Africa, the country will be expelled from the Citi World Government Bond Index, which will likely result in projected outflows of R100-billion.
