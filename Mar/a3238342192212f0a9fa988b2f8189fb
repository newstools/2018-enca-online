JOHANNESBURG - Paris St Germain forward Neymar faces a race against time to be fit for this year's World Cup finals after the Brazil team doctor was quoted on Thursday saying that he would be out for up to three months with a foot injury. The 26-year-old is to undergo surgery on a fractured metatarsal and a sprained ankle this week. Brazil's team doctor Rodrigo Lasmar said Neymar will need up to three months to recover from the injury.

"Neymar is, of course, upset, sad, down. But he understands that there is no option now other than to recuperate and dedicate himself to recuperating so he can be as good as soon as possible." PSG confirmed the injury on Wednesday, ruling him out of the club's Champions League last-16, second leg, against Spanish holders Real Madrid.

"He will be operated on in Brazil at the end of the week." Initially Neymar's father predicted the injury would keep his son out for between six to eight weeks, giving him plenty of time to recover for the tournament in Russia. Neymar has scored 28 goals and provided 16 assists for the Ligue 1 leaders this season. AFP
