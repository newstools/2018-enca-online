WASHINGTON – US Open champion Sloane Stephens again ended former world number one Victoria Azarenka's hopes of a fairytale comeback by beating her 3-6 6-2 6-1 on Thursday to reach the Miami Open final. Three-times champion Azarenka, playing as a wildcard in her second event after an eight-month absence because of a custody dispute involving her son, showed glimpses of the form that took her to the top of the rankings but ultimately ran out of gas against her 13th-seeded opponent. Sloane Stephens wins 12 of the last 13 games to beat Victoria Azarenka 3-6, 6-2, 6-1 and reach in Miami her 1st final since the US Open title.
		
		Also her 2nd biggest ever final.
