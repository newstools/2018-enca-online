JOHANNESBURG – The highly-contentious mining charter will be finalised by May, Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe said on Tuesday. He said the top priority at the moment was to assure investors of policy certainty.

He said transformation could occur in a growing and competitive mining industry, and the emphasis on transformation is on a mining industry that benefits producers – big and small, workers, communities and the economy of South Africa as a whole. eNCA
