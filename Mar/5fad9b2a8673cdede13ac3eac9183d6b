JOHANNESBURG - On 9 March 1876, the first successful test of a telephone was made by Alexander Graham Bell. According to the Independent Telecommunications Pioneer Association, the telecommunications race was cut throat even in 1872. Alexander Graham Bell and Elisha Gray were both independently working on devices that could transmit sound among electrical cables and registered their patens within hours of each other. It resulted in a lightly legal battle, but Bell won in the end. Before the telephone, the main communication system for about 30 years was the telegraph which used Morse code and could only send and receive one message at a time. Bell’s first phone call was to his assistant, Thomas Watson, who was in an adjoining room, and he said to him: "Mr Watson, come here, I want to speak to you." By 1918, it was estimated that approximately ten million Bell system telephones were in service throughout the US. Only in the 40s did the world’s first mobile phone service become operational and it worked via radio waves.

In the last three decades, phones have evolved to contain individual transmitters.
