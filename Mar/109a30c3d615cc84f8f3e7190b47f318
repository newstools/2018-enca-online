PRETORIA - A syndicate is believed to be targeting schools in Atteridgeville, west of Pretoria. Education officials say they’re stealing food meant for hungry pupils. For most children, it’s their only meal of the day and the Department's now scrambling to replenish stocks before schools open on Monday. Gauteng Education Department spokesperson Steve Mabona said the pupils need to be fed as they need to focus.
