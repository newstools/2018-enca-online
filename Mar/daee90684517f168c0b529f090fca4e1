BELGRADE - Serbian authorities cancelled a high-risk women's under-20 handball World Cup qualifier between former foes Serbia and Kosovo on Friday, citing security reasons as nationalists intended to protest against it. Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia in 2008, but Belgrade still does not recognise the move. Relations between the two nations, who fought an 18-month war in the late 1990s, remain tense. The Group 5 match was to be played later on Friday in Kovilovo, near Belgrade. But a few hours before kick-off, the Serbian interior ministry decided to cancel it "over security reasons", Prime Minister Ana Brnabic's office said, quoted by Beta news agency. The match was originally due to be played in the central town of Kragujevac but was both moved to Kovilovo and set to be played without fans or media due to security concerns. Local media reported that the decision to call off the match was made after dozens of hardline Serbian fans started gathering at the Kovilovo sports centre venue from Thursday evening. They waved Serbian flags and sang patriotic songs,Â media reported. Police were deployed in large numbers at the venue on Friday. "Could we ensure that the match was held? Certainly. But what would be the price?" Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic said, cited by B92 television's internet site. That price would be "clashes between our people and police over an issue we don't believe in," Stefanovic added. "We are not prepared for the police to beat people in order to ensure a match that is against our views be held." Kosovo, only a partially-recognised state, is nonetheless a member of many international sports federations such as FIFA and the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). AFP
