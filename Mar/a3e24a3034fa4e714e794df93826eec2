JOHANNESBURG – Kaizer Chiefs' title ambitions suffered another setback after they were only able to muster a 0-0 Premiership draw with AmaZulu at the FNB Stadium on Saturday evening. Steve Komphela's side, who have only claimed two points from their last three outings, have six league fixtures still to play this season and now find themselves seven points behind log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns, who have also played one game fewer. 90 +4’| #KC 0 : 0 #AFC

		#KCOneTeam #AbsaPrem AmaZulu, who had let in three goals last weekend against National First Division side Ubuntu CT in a 3-2 Nedbank Cup loss, looked determined to keep a tight ship at the back in Soweto on Saturday night. And from this perspective it was mission accomplished for Cavin Johnson's team as they gave Chiefs very little in front of goal. The first half proved a cagey and physical affair, the game stopped regularly for the physios to attend to injuries. Amakhosi had to work hard to create chances, with Leonardo Castro sending an early header wide from a Siphiwe Tshabalala free kick, while at the other end, Mhlengi Cele and Siyethemba Mnguni fired in off-target shots for AmaZulu.

Mnguni was then went close to putting Usuthu ahead in the 38th minute, when his thunderous drive from range whistled narrowly past the upright. Amakhosi had a sniff on goal eight minutes after the restart, but Castro allowed the ball to get away from him in a promising position. #AbsaPrem TABLE pic.twitter.com/O3m4maLkeX AmaZulu, though, were very much in the game and they had chances as Ovidy Kararu missed at the near post from just a few metres out, before Itumeleng Khune made a good stop to keep out Mnguni. The Glamour Boys continued to probe for openings, but just couldn't break down a resolute Usuthu defence, the hosts also having to be wary of the Durban side's counter-attack. Indeed, with some excellent defending in front of him, AmaZulu keeper Murambadoro was not tested in the closing minutes of the game, despite Chiefs' efforts to attack as the two sides played to a goal-less draw for the second time in the league this season.
