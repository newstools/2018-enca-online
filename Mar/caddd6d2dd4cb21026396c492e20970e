JOHANNESBURG - The Western Cape Government is preparing itself for another dry summer season. In it's latest water update, the provincial Department of Local Government, Environmental Affairs,  and Development Planning urges the public to keep preserving water as the province cannot rely on winter rainfall (the Cape is a winter rainfall area).

We need to retain as much water in storage as possible as we go into the summer of 2018/19," said MEC Anton Bredell. Bredell acknowledged the change in leadership at national level.
