We ask for respect for the family’s privacy at this time. We will communicate further information when we have it, if appropriate," Bellairs said. "For the vast majority of our cyclists and those working behind the scenes, the 2018 Cape Town Cycle Tour reached a successful culmination after months of hard work. But three families are in mourning for the three lives lost on the route this year. Two participants died during the 40th edition of the cycling event on Sunday in separate incidents. "One cyclist succumbed to his wounds at the scene of a pileup with other cyclists at the base of Wynberg Hill, another is suspected to have experienced a heart attack going up the hill at Smitswinkel Bay, and, as stated, we are awaiting confirmation regarding the marshall," Bellairs said. "I want to assure everyone that all measures are taken to ensure participants’ and marshalls’ safety on the route. In my 28 years working on the Cycle Tour, there have been only two  trauma-related deaths on the day of Cycle Tour." On Sunday, more than 160 participants received medical attention and as many as 78 were transferred to hospital. eNCA
