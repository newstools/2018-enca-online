It affirmed Absa, Standard Bank, Investec, First Rand, Mercantile Bank and Nedbank’s long-term local- and foreign-currency deposit ratings at investment grade. Moody's said this is due to a stable and predictable political and economic environment following the changes in South Africa's government.
