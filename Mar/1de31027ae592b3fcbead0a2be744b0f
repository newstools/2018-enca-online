JOHANNESBURG – The Patriotic Alliance (PA) has come out guns blazing against Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Jilius Malema. Parties are at loggerheads over the issue of whether Nelson Mandela Bay Metro (NMBM) Mayor Athol Trollip should be removed from office. Crowds gathered outside the city hall at noon, united against the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and African National Congress (ANC) ‘coalition of corruption’ seeking to oust the mayor. Today at 12h00, we gather outside City Hall in Nelson Mandela Bay, united against the EFF/ANC coalition of corruption.

He labelled Malema an “arrogant racist.” READ: Battle for NMB: PA throws support behind Athol Trollip Daniels said other parties thought the PA would jump when offered a big bone. eNCA
