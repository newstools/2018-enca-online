JOHANNESBURG - Talks have broken down between insurer MiWay and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini, over a leaked recording of a conversation between the salesman and the monarch. The incident occurred early in February and the recording went viral on social media. LISTEN: Zulu King scolds, blesses MiWay sales agent At the time, the royal Zulu household said it would consider taking MiWay to court, for not protecting the king's private information. In a statement issued Saturday, the king's lawyer, Theasen Pillay, reiterated the monarch is thinking about taking legal action after MiWay did not provide it with satisfactory answers to questions, including how the recording was leaked and how the king's personal number was obtained. The kind also wanted to know whether the party responsible for leaking the recording had been disciplined and whether measures have been taken to ensure it does not happen again. "It is offensive and repugnant, not to mention socially and commercially unacceptable, for any institution to misuse and/or abuse an individual’s personal information," Pillay said.

If His Majesty can be subjected to such mockery, one can only imagine the extent of the travesties that the 'ordinary man on the street' must endure." In its own statement on Saturday, the office of the king called MiWay's attitude "nonchalant". "The South African consumer and the business communities must be aware of the disgraceful and appalling tactics that MiWay uses. By MiWay choosing to be decisively silent about explaining itself, is a further act of contempt and indifference. This cannot and will not be accepted," the statement reads. eNCA
