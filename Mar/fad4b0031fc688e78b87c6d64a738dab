PORT ELIZABETH – Southern Kings flyhalf Kurt Coleman has undergone an operation after suffering a knee injury against Benetton Treviso at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in a Pro14 clash on Saturday. Coleman was forced from the field in the 34th minute and Southern Kings team doctor Lizanne Pieterse broke the news on Monday when she revealed that the flyhalf and playmaker had suffered a fracture to his lower left leg. "Kurt underwent an operation on Sunday morning. The operation was without complications and he is recovering well but will, unfortunately, be out of action for six months as a result," said Dr Pieterse. The doctor also advised that wing Anthony Volmink had not yet recovered from an injury to his left knee and would not be available for the Kings next match against Munster in two weeks' time. Southern Kings coach Deon Davids bemoaned the fact that his went down by a single point (36-35) to Benetton Treviso after each team scored five tries. "I'm really disappointed with the result and, with all due respect to Benetton, I think this was a game that we lost more than what they won," said Davids, "Our concentration was poor at the start and we let them get away and thereafter we just made too many basic and fundamental errors, like kicks not finding touch for instance. That allowed the opposition to stay in the game." "I also thought Kurt Coleman was playing well for us and losing him during the first half also didn’t help our cause." The Kings's next fixture against Munster takes place at Outeniqua Park in George on Saturday, 7 April. African News Agency
