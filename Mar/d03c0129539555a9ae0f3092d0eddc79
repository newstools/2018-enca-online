The human rights commissioner said there were several steps businesses could take to support human rights because it was impossible for government alone to enforce these rights in a country plagued by poverty and unemployment. “Businesses  can get involved in their communities and establish codes of conduct for how their businesses operate, as well as follow labour laws,” said Majola.
