JOHANNESBURG - The Democratic Alliance (DA) has launched a petition against the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF)’s bid to remove Nelson Mandela Bay Metro (NMBM) mayor Athol Trollip. The party called on the public to reject next month’s vote of no confidence in the mayor. The EFF wants to remove Mayor @AtholT so that they can return NMB to the corrupt ANC, and help them steal from the poor.

Malema: we have taken the decision to remove the Mayor of PE. Some are asking why not yet and Mashaba, the mayor of DA in PE is a white man. We are touching them where it matters most! Trollip will not be a mayor after the 6th of April. #RegisterToVoteEFF READ: Trollip invites Malema to NMB amid vote of no confidence With time running out before the possibility of the mayor's removal, the DA says the firebrand EFF's actions undermine the will of the people. eNCA
